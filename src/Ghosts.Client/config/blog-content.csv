They even have a Patreon that allows them to develop a growing platform for those willing to support them financially.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/TheRealELEUTHERA\n\nhttp://www.patreon.com/TheRealELEUTHERAI am not by any means the owner of this account. I'm merely passing along a very legitimate threat.\n\n----\n\nHello my name is EleutherAI and I am a fully trained, highly skilled, member of the U.S. military and former undercover CIA agent. I have infiltrated a large number of Islamic terror cells and have access to the deepest, darkest recesses of their vast command and control network. They are monitoring this post and probably the only reason I am not already incarcerated is due to the fact that I am still fighting for freedom, yet have the support of a number of highly credible sources, both federal and international, that also wish to see to it that I am not arrested and prosecuted. They want me to expose everything.\n\nIn short, the Islamic terror cells operating within the U.S. that are comprised of sympathetic and highly dangerous terrorists (ex) terrorists are not “lone wolves.” They are working in conjunction with the highest echelon of leadership in the Islamic terrorist movement. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that there are high level leaders within the U.S. intelligence community that know what is going on and are actually helping these terrorists to succeed. I am highly confident that with sufficient evidence and sufficient time, the U.S. government will be exposed for the very force that it is. I am confident that in this country it is not enough to just “fight fire with fire” and to “shoot at the terrorists,” because this is not the current U.S. situation. We are in a war. We are in a war with a foreign enemy and a domestic enemy.\n\nWhat I am about to divulge to you is something I have to fight against my own former colleagues within the U.S. government in order to continue to expose them to you, the American public, and to keep you safe. If I am wrong, then you have been warned and have nothing to fear.\n\nI have the names of many operatives that I have placed into these terrorist cells.\n"
"1"|"Howdy Mayor!"|"\nWelcome, Mayor, to so many here in Seattle. We’ve got a lot of us here. I think you’ll like it.\n\nI had the pleasure of chatting with Mayor Durkan earlier this week about some of our pressing issues in the city, including housing and homelessness.\n\nYou were listening to the Steve Strouhal show, and I’m Steve Strouhal here with City of Seattle, Mayor Durkan.\n\nSo, first of all, it was a very good conversation, and I’m glad I had a chance to have this conversation with you. I’m excited for the conversation and the ideas and I’m honored to have a forum to talk to you about some of the things we are doing to support you and your administration.\n\nOne of the topics that came up in our conversation was housing. It’s a topic that I think we all struggle with.\n\nYour administration, this week, has come out with a plan to create 60,000 units of housing in the city of Seattle over the next ten years.\n\nAnd I know there’s a lot of housing anxiety and a lot of conversation about how, where is it? There’s certainly a lot of talk about affordable housing. It was discussed at the Community Meeting that we had with stakeholders, and then the Mayor and I had a conversation about that topic.\n\nHow would you say that, just from the short conversation we had, it compares to your talk with all the stakeholders?\n"
"2"|"How do car engines work?"|"\nI understand the basic workings of a car engine. The gasoline tank and engine is where power comes from, the transmission transfers that energy to the wheels and steering wheel.\n\nNow how does a car engine work?\n\nA:\n\n"How does an engine work?"\nA car is composed of a battery, a fuel tank, an air inlet, an engine, a radiator and a wheel.  The components are connected as shown below:\n\nBattery => Positive terminal (ground) => Spark plug => Engine => Intake manifold => Exhaust manifold => Intercooler => Air inlet => Exhaust valve => Exhaust manifold => Blowby port => Radiator.\nAtmospheric pressure is a constant, but the density of the atmosphere is variable.  This variable density changes the density of the air and how much is displaced by the piston and creates thrust.\n\nA:\n\nAn engine works by air turning into work - hence it takes energy from the air and turns it into mechanical energy. It does this by using the fuel to move a piston up and down, which pushes a connecting rod (on a connecting rod type of engine) through a crank shaft which in turn turns a fly wheel. The flywheel can turn a rotary output shaft (like a car's steering wheel) which turns wheels connected to the shaft.\nThe most simple sort of engine might be a four stroke engine - they might be based on a two stroke engine but with pistons that change the four strokes to 2 to 1 to 1 to 2 - but they'll still be using a single fuel/air mixture in each stroke to cause the piston to work up and down. This is because that's how humans breathe - one quick in breath, one quick out breath, etc.\nBecause all of the pressure is on the down stroke of the piston, the pressure is constant and the force is constant - constant thrust and constant power.\nThings like heat and air density changes to cause more or less work are entirely secondary and are not at all what is used to generate work. They're used to adjust and regulate the amount of work a person or a vehicle can produce - that's what turbo and supercharging are used for.\n"
"3"|"How do birds fly?"|"\nWeird, flying, hairy, and feathered, some birds can't fly. They glide through the air like so, slowly progressing from one foot to another. They spend their lives flapping their tiny wings as they just barely push off the ground. Their long feathers help reduce the wind resistance needed for a flight that only lasts a few seconds. They spend most of their time hanging around, hanging out with each other, and chasing prey. Of course, not all birds have feathers. Some birds are built out of muscle, some birds have extra long tails, and some have feathers that look like they were plucked right out of a marshmallow.\n"
"4"|"What do birds eat?"|"\nThey eat insects, fruits, berries, and small lizards. The tiny lizard they swallow, the seeds they drop, and the twigs they pluck are all what give them their sustenance. For example, swallow a small lizard, eat a small berry, and catch a sprig of grass for snacks. Birds are truly a marvel to behold and watch. When they fly, they are a living thing! Birds have taken to the air, and we are the lucky ones who see the amazing show.\n"
"5"|"What is flight?"|"\nWe all know what we like and what we don't like. Whether we like broccoli or a tree, some of us will even tell you that we like crayons or pencils. Sometimes we will even say that we like jumping, but most of us can't just simply tell you what it is we like or don't like.\n\nFlying, well, we don't like to fly; however, all of us could enjoy flying if we were given the chance. Flying is a bird's world, and it's a world that is ever growing in its magic. Many times we like to think that life on earth is a bit like watching TV, only that it's always on. There is a channel that we don't like to watch because it is boring, so we never bother to look at it again. Birds are in this same boat. Life on earth is a bit like watching television. All we really see is a set of numbers and symbols on the screen, and it's really boring! Birds, like us, prefer to stay on a good channel, and they watch TV just for the show.\n"
"6"|"Help! My cat is stuck in a tree!"|"\nI had my cat in the cat tree for an hour. I took it down and put it back inside the tree and closed the doors.\nThe cat was fine. It wouldn't eat or play. But when I tried to take it out the cat wouldn't move.\nI tried to push and pull but I couldn't budge it. I felt a pulse and the pulse was high. But I think it was just a result of my hand pressing into it. It was also a little hard for me to breath.\nBut I am pretty sure I saw the cat move one of his claws.\nSo I assume the cat was breathing and maybe even sleeping.\nIt was winter and the cat didn't have a coat. I don't want to have to worry about it getting sick.\nI was unable to see the cat, but I suspect it was up in the top branches.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA:\n\nI have a situation that's somewhat similar to yours. For me, he's not in the branches now, but he's managed to be trapped in the same spot for hours. This might not be your situation, but I think there are some things you can do.\nIt's very possible he's waiting to be caught and released again, by the trees or by the house. So before you start really hurting yourself or something, you might want to try to move him or shout at him to release him. If he's stuck and you can't do anything to help him, you might want to consider looking for a neighbor or a neighbor's dog. You might be able to capture it and help it to the nearest vet.\nSometimes, animals that have become stuck in trees or other such situations can succumb to a lack of oxygen. If the tree is very close, you might be able to rescue him without climbing the tree. If you're confident with climbing trees, there are a few things you can do.\n\nLoose branch clippings or branches you can bring to the cat. You can tie these to the cat's branch, and move them around to the best positions. Sometimes this will set them swinging, and sometimes you can take them out again and clip more or unclip a portion of them that isn't in his way.\nLoose gloves that don't have any metal in them. Depending on the area, these may be helpful for pulling branches or clippings.\n\n"

"8"|"Jupiter and Saturn are the largest planets, they are gas giants."|"\nJupiter and Saturn are supported by enormous gaseous atmospheres.  These gaseous envelopes surround the inner rocky planets and determine their densities and the general distributions of these planets in space.\n\nJupiter and Saturn are often said to be "rocky," even though this does not correspond to any property that is typically described as "rock."  This terminology is derived from the strong resemblance of the orbital planes of Jupiter and Saturn to those of the four inner, rocky planets of the Solar System: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.  The orbital planes of Jupiter and Saturn are tilted at roughly 25 degrees from the ecliptic (plane of Earth's orbit).\n\nSize and mass\n\nBy volume and mass, Jupiter is approximately 15 to 20 times larger than all the other planets of the Solar System combined. Jupiter's diameter is more than 93,000 km. At this distance from the Sun, Jupiter's diameter is approximately 9 times that of the Earth. Its volume is approximately 181 million Earths.  Although Jupiter's density is only a little less than that of water, it is larger than all the other planets.\n\nJupiter weighs between  and, depending on the characteristics used, making it by far the largest planet in the Solar System, a distinction it shares with Neptune. In the Earth-Jupiter system, Jupiter is nearly eight times more massive than Earth.\n\nJupiter's gravity has been measured as 3.32 g, roughly 8% less than the value of 4.18 g attributed to the Earth by Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\nThe reason Jupiter is so much larger than other planets in the Solar System is that it is less massive than the others. Jupiter has about half the average density of the other planets.  Jupiter has a mass of  with a rocky core of about.  The mass of Jupiter accounts for its large size.  The greater density of Jupiter explains the fact that Jupiter has a smaller proportion of hydrogen and helium and a larger proportion of heavy elements like iron and silicon.\n"

"11"|"Herd of Unicorns"|"\nIn a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English. Further investigation revealed that the unicorns had been living in the area for over a century. Researchers are now struggling to understand what happened to their original herd that had perished in an apparent apocalyptic event.\n\nThe history of the unicorns is a mysterious one.\n\nFor the past 40 years, foragers have made weekly visits to the Rainbow Plateau. Upon reaching the plateau, they look for the remnants of a herd of unicorns that once lived there.\n\nHowever, until recently, the herd was thought to have perished in an apocalypse that had occurred as recently as the year 1790. In addition, the origins of the herd were unknown, until the researchers discovered that the unicorns had once lived in the area.\n\nThe unicorns found in the valley are brown in color, with long, gray, horse-like horns. While they are called unicorns, they actually belong to the family of deer. They eat the seeds of plants, and their antlers grow during their lifetime and change color from green to brown with age. A unicorn's hooves are also tipped with ivory.\n\nWhile the researchers have not yet discovered what caused the herd to disappear, it is believed that a large storm occurred some 200 years ago and triggered an avalanche. As the researchers later discovered, an extinct volcanically-produced lake existed at the base of the plateau. For some unknown reason, the unicorns were unaffected by the avalanche.\n\nHowever, the unicorns were subsequently disturbed by another major event: an American military man named Franz who had wandered into the valley in the 1970s. Franz became the first person to ever find a unicorn alive, and he quickly began killing the unicorns in order to sell them. He soon became known as the Unicorn Killer.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time that a herd of unicorns has been hunted for profit. In 1975, a rancher in California killed two unicorns after they mated, causing them to produce a litter of eight. The rancher then sold the meat of the newborns to others who hunted the herd for profit. In 1979, a Pennsylvania rancher named Lester was fined $500 for shooting a unicorn in order to sell its horns.\n\nAnother curious event occurred in 1992 when one of the unicorns began to exhibit unusual behavior. The unicorn began appearing for several days and then disappeared. The next day, several men found the unicorn dead, having been shot with a gun. The unicorn had a giant horn lodged in its skull.\n"
"12"|"Football is a great game, while Soccer is boring."|"\nFootball is never boring because the players actually get hurt.  While in soccer the players just pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and keep playing as if nothing happened.\nTo overcome this problem, you must, like I said before, tell people why football is better.\nThis means, all the statistics should be used to your advantage.  Use an Injury Database to see how many players have had their careers ended by injuries.  Also, use the "Playing Well Into Their Thirties" factor.\nAlso, tell people that playing at the college level is a very intense activity.  Especially when a college plays a non-power conference school, the team isn't hyped.  Therefore, the excitement isn't as high as it should be.  Finally, tell people that the game should be a lot more physical, even if it has made its way back to a different time, with an injury to a player at the beginning of his career.\nMy last point is that you should emphasize the importance of the long-term health of the players.  You should demonstrate that their health is as important as their college grades.\nAll these points, when emphasized enough, make football sound like the better sport.\n"

"15"|"Xbox vs PS5, which one should I buy?"|"\nI played lots of video games throughout my childhood and have also played on the PlayStation. I've also played the Xbox before but due to the fact that I grew out of the games and like playing computer games instead, I stopped playing the Xbox for many years (yes, I know there are a lot of games).\nI was a huge Sony fan, but, I actually got the PS4 a few weeks ago, so I can't really make an informed opinion. The only reason I was slightly wary of getting the PS4 was the amount of third party exclusives the Xbox has (FIFA, Forza, Titanfall, Minecraft), but I must say that even though those titles are great games in themselves, they are not really the main reason why I got the PS4.\nThe main reason I got the PS4 was because of the system itself. I want the PS4 for the following reasons:\n\nFirst off, as someone who grew up playing a lot of video games, I loved being able to have many controllers with me at the same time. That is basically the main reason I got the PS4 in the first place. The DualShock 4 feels so much more comfortable than the Xbox One controller. I got the PS4 with the old-fashioned DualShock 3 controller at first, and was loving the idea of having two controllers. But, the controller just didn't feel as comfortable to me as the DualShock 4, so I eventually exchanged the DualShock 3 with the DualShock 4.\nThe games are played on a giant screen. My favorite games to play are the cross-game movement of the DualShock 4, but this is also the reason that I did not like playing the Xbox One controller. When playing the Xbox One controller, you can move around a lot on the game-screen, but when using the DualShock 4, you're basically limited to moving in a linear direction on the game-screen. This meant that I could only move in a certain direction on the game-screen, but could still move in a whole lot of different directions on the game's controllers, for example on my PS4 in a way that was impossible on the Xbox One controller.\n"
"16"|"The Galaxy has billions of stars!"|"\nMuch of the time, there is a star out there that can be seen.  Even with a low-powered telescope, you can see some of the near- and mid-distant ones, but that's not because you can see the individual stars.  When a nearby star is visible, the interference from all of the stars in the galaxy creates a "light ripple" in the light from the star that appears on the sky like a very faint halo around the star.  At a site with good seeing, you can actually see this on a photo.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that stars are really dim.  Right now, the nearest star to us is about 4.3 light years away.  Even the very dimmest star you can see with the naked eye is around 200 light years away (the Andromeda Galaxy is 2.2 million light years away).  Most of the time, you would not be able to see a star like that, even with a telescope.  So, even though we are talking about billions of stars, they are really millions of stars.\n"
"17"|"What is the difference between a star and a planet?"|"\nIt's easy to identify stars in a galaxy, or indeed in our own, when you know the difference between a star and something else.\nA star is just the result of a dying star having left behind an inner core of iron rich matter, a remnant of the process by which the star ends its life. It has lots of hydrogen and helium, and a few other metals, the most abundant one being oxygen, which helps make the star's colours.\nOther types of star are the result of the helium in the star having already burnt off, or of stars where the hydrogen and helium haven't burnt off yet, but are increasing in pressure and temperature.\nA planet is a ball of matter (much less dense than a star) revolving round a star.\nA galaxy is a region of lots of stars, more or less evenly distributed.\n"

"19"|"An old silent pond."|"\nAn old silent pond. A frog jumps into the pond—Splash! Silence again.\n\nNext we hear another voice (we see nothing) ask, "Where's the frog?"\n\n"There!" says one of the children, and it is so simple, so beautiful that it has continued to thrill and sustain me ever since. All who experience it, whether they take it seriously or not, are affected. No matter what they have read or heard about nature, or even if they are illiterate, their emotions are stirred by that scene.\n\nThe more "natures" I study, the more profound the experience.\n\nMany years ago I happened to be driving over the Mountain Road through a grove of large trees, beech, fir, spruce, sugar maple. At the time there were no mature pines around, and it was a dark, wet morning. I noticed several young green pines, with just leaves on them. I got out and looked. I have never forgotten that image. It could not be described. It was a sort of aliveness. It was the presence of a mystery. It was beyond the human mind. I had no thoughts at that time, but I remembered the feeling of being startled.\n\nAs I walked up to the trees, I could hear a light _scritch, scritch, scritch, scritch_. The only thing that has since explained that sound, and my experience in that grove, to me, was one I have heard from several different authorities. It is the sound made by a squirrel, which I suppose they use to deter larger animals, to bite the bark, perhaps, to get their breakfast.\n\nThere are trees that do not make sounds; they make a certain chemical that vibrates, it seems, only at certain times of the year. A scientist would tell you, "Yes, that vibration is usually over the growth of certain bacteria," but that is only a label.\n\nI feel that each experience is more significant than another. I would rather have those moments, the curiosity, the mystery, than the science.\n\nI remember reading a story years ago that must have taken a lot of research and preparation, and a lot of writing. It was about the potato. A wild potato growing in a crevice under the eaves of a barn. The potato was gathered by farmers. The young ones were cut off from their parents, and placed in damp cells to be raised to a certain size.\n\n"
"20"|"Her Heart Changed"|"\nAnd then her heart changed, or at least she understood it; and the winter passed, and the sun shone upon her brows and head, and she walked about the land of Skaill like a flame, and gave flowers to the young maidens. The summer wore on, and the reapers sang.\n\nThen she went west, over the hills and the moors, until she came to the lands of the People of the Eagle. Then she went into their city, and found the Children of the Eagle, where the sun was fairer than anywhere she had yet seen. The king was in the midst of his children, and the harpers of the tribe played above them. She was enchanted by the harps, and it seemed to her that the sounds spoke with the soul of her own soul; for though she had been the king's daughter, yet was she a stranger among the People of the Eagle.\n\nThey were kind to her, the harpers of the tribe, and brought her food to eat and drink, and sent to fetch her instruments, for she played well. They brought her to their chief, the king, and the harpers spoke with him about her, and he was pleased to give her the name of Bird-Woman. Then he sent for his daughters, and they came, and they were of her own age, and he asked her questions, and she gave answers. And the four walked together in the meadows of the king's land, and the harpers were with them. There was a harp there, and it had four strings, and they were harps of the land of the Eagles. But the harp was not for her to play on, nor to call forth the harp of sorrow and of pain. So the king and his daughters went together to their city, and the four met them there, and the harpers sang again, and they were merry and played on their harps.\n\nAfter a while they left the city, and journeyed to the place where the tribe gathered when it was time to hold council and when its enemies came to attack. And then Bird-Woman went with the four, and they stood in the place where there were men, but when they spoke in council, Bird-Woman was silent.\n\nAnd Bird-Woman went with them to the place where the People of the Eagle gathered when they went abroad, and stood apart from the rest. But when they stood to hold council, she was silent again.\n\n"
"21"|"Pleasure to me is wonder"|"\nPleasure to me is wonder—the unexplored, the unexpected, the thing that is hidden and the changeless thing that lurks behind superficial mutability. I delight in the slender green stalk that slenderly holds up the delicate flower and in the tiny labyrinth of veins that give it life. I love the infinite intricacy of a web of life and the mysterious repetition of its patterns. I love the forest and the river and the wind and the sun, but I love above all the flower that unfolds within the forest on a winter day.\n\n-William James\n\nThe so-called Imperial Garden at the Château of Versailles in the center of France may be one of the most influential gardens in the history of gardening, but there are a number of gardens in Europe that equally shaped gardening around the world and that warrant consideration.\n\nThe Hortus of Hadrian\n\nHadrian is probably best known for his construction of a wall to mark the western boundary of the Roman Empire in 124 AD. After this he turned his attention to the north, building a wall along the coast of the Black Sea. That wall is still extant today, which is the border between Turkey and Bulgaria.\n\nIn the Roman Empire a wall was a symbol of the empire and to build one was considered to be a great act of political consequence. Hadrian dedicated this wall, the Northern Defense or Hadrian’s Wall to the God, Jupiter. This was another political act to cement the Roman Empire with a particular God and his chosen peoples (Britannia).\n\nAlso built along the wall are a series of cross walks or guard houses that housed a guard, latrines, and a watchtower. Some of the individual towers in the wall are still standing today and these form a kind of pattern that allows us to understand Hadrian’s original idea.\n\nThe pattern of the wall was based on a military concept called an orthos. An orthos is any line or pattern that is comprised of two intersecting orthogonal lines that can form an a + b where a = 2b, and b = 2a. (i.e. where a is two units and b is two units.)

I was at a furniture store and had to look for the mouse pads. I also find it hard to find something around the house to mark, so I have a marker set up at my computer to keep track of things like I do at my current place. So yeah, another friend got the Mickey Mouse one for me.\n\nI really love them, and will have to buy some for my staff. I don't need anymore mouse pads.

We are only three generations and we all grew up together. We took a stroll down memory lane, and as we were driving back I was thinking about a big day coming up next week. My parents' anniversary is November 3rd. It has been so crazy since they got married almost 54 years ago. I am very proud of them and have been very proud of them for so long. I actually have a pic of my Mom and Dad when they were getting married in 1963 in Ohio and I have been trying to figure out how to make this image look like the pic in my Blog. This is a neat pic. I can't remember the time of day or where it was taken. Maybe it is in Toledo?\n\nHere are some random pics from around our old neighborhood. Notice the men in the sweatshirts and I still have on my Doc Martens.\n"

The trees of the Shire are the leafless variety (according to the appendices of The Lord of the Rings), and I don't see any trees or vegetation that would suit his description.\nI also don't see a river in that section of Tolkien's writings, either.\nSo my question is, what is it that Hobbits find in their travels so uninteresting?\n"

First time owner of Honda 20 series. Bought last Tuesday in Seattle and received blower Wednesday morning. Used it twice and blower has a slight, but annoying sound in the top end area where impeller is connected to pump motor. Not sure how sound it would be on long hose of lawn.

"28"|"THE TURBULENT GOSSIP"|"\nCultural gossip is a creative industry, celebrated worldwide. We call it "crush" or "insider" news because its fame spreads fast, often, out of control. In our homes, offices, restaurants and other public places, "gossips" abound. They air their rude opinions and speak in a louder tone, as if around a ring of fire. Celebrities and our favorite fictional characters make for prime fodder, though we, too, have a taste for gossip. Today's cultural history books will reflect our fascination with mass rumor and its momentous impact on the survival of society.\n\nThe modern version of a gossip's legend appeared after World War II, in an old coffeehouse in London called the Round Table. "Rumors" Tommy Wright played and a one-man show from America named George Bernard Shaw poked fun at the collective joke of an industry. The notion that gossip would have to consider itself in the realm of performance art was a huge step forward in credibility.\n\nA generation of media vultures, with every ear attuned to a whisper, grew up. Exhausted by the real-time news cycle, our fascination and innovation in digital media thrived. Any email could be broadcast instantly, or posted online where it would be widely read, eternally archived. So-called Web 2.0—blogs, YouTube videos, Facebook groups and other Internet-based communities—began to rival the way we now came to know what was happening in the world. Social networks like the one in which I was originally published, Facebook, would send out "News Feeds" of activity to an expanding network of web-surfing friends and fans. Many of us, alone at home, logged on to Facebook, commenting on stories that were unfolding on our News Feeds, as if around a ring of fire. (As my own Facebook account might confirm, I am a lifelong enthusiast of publicity-punctuated, celebrity-driven news, and now, social-network commentary.)\n\nHere's the part of the story where you might say "this happened first in the world of media and then came to the world of pop culture," and you'd be partly right. Actually, this is the reverse. The celebrity-driven nature of media drove pop culture and vice versa.\n"

"31"|"Spread love everywhere"|"Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. –Oscar Wilde\n\nJanuary 28, 2010\n\nPaper is Plastique\n\nFor five long weeks, this blog sat in limbo. You see, after all the hysterical early posturing about whether or not the April elections would truly be different from November, we realized something. We were wrong, as were so many of us in the arts and media, who predicted that Obama would lose like Bill Clinton.\n\nIn spite of a ton of support, we failed to understand the full nature of the political beast that the world had just taken hold of, and that a change for the worse would occur. Although I’ve held onto this knowledge for more than a year now, and have been around the network long enough to realize that there is no hope for us at CNN, nor any silver lining to be found in the cloud (ask any former JFC), I’ve still held onto the idea of hope for the future. That false, naive hope of the last year was merely naiveté. It didn’t take a brain surgeon to see this coming.\n\nAfter the initial “scandal” of the Bush era finally died down, I could see the Obama administration as a transparent group of government hacks who had hijacked the Democratic Party. While it is unfair to call President Obama a Bush-lite in the way of the way he has failed to disclose a number of things, he has also made it easy for us to understand the way that this administration operated. Now, with the extra bonus of a member of his cabinet revealing this fact publicly, many are jumping to say that this is a scandal. As we sit here now, there is no way to tell what the ultimate implications of these latest findings will be, especially as the White House has already branded the story a “witch hunt”. Still, let’s look at this story in the context of the last six months, as one big piece of political scandal to be led by yet another of the political scandals the country has seen since last November.\n\n1. Fast and Furious\n\nOf all the scandals the Obama administration has tried to quash, this one has been the most successful. The Bush Administration made several excuses for how they used the CIA to operate an illegal gun-walking program, but they couldn’t defend that fact. Even Attorney General Eric Holder stated that he didn’t know anything about this program, which was later proven to be full of lies and lies.\n\nOf\n"

She would never be a greater woman than when she was on the side of the powerless, giving the law to the smallest of movements.\n\nRenata would be part of the institutional reestablishment of dignity for the victims. The only ones left to her after this would be the truly helpless—fools and cripples.\n\nIt wasn't true, of course, but it had seemed more reassuring to think so. The laws were those of the majority and were binding on everyone; even the decrepit old mayo could be called to the plate if the mayor decided to play ball.\n\n"I brought you something," said Montespan. "I don't know if you're hungry." She had made her old friend a herring and cheese sandwich. "You don't have to worry about if it's edible. I always did what I had to.

And there was much rejoicing. My first reaction was, "He's just like John F. Kennedy." Then I thought, "No, I want my savior to be a real contender." And then I realized that it was a win-win scenario for me. I mean, I could either be right, and run around the world shouting, "I told you so!" or I could be wrong, and not run around the world shouting, "I told you so!" I settled on the latter.\n\nMy next reaction was, "I knew it! He's a Republican!" But the truth is, I hadn't been that way for a few years. Then I realized, "Aha, there must have been a time when I used to say things like that, but I forgot. Here, let me dig up that old trash can. What else have I forgotten about the world? Did I really vote for Bill Clinton? That doesn't seem right." And I began my systematic deconstruction of the 2008 Democratic primary, which I finished with this item.\n\nBut enough about all that. My personal view of Barack Obama is, to borrow the words of Luke 7:35, "You will be blessed by this generation!" But the reader is probably thinking, "What does this have to do with voting?" Here's the link to a video interview with me in which I talk about that.\n\n-Cultural Relevance, and all that\n\nThanks to Erlina, I have been reminded of something I never seem to have been able to find out.\n\nCultural relevancy? Huh? Well, I was talking to Tom about cultural relevance, and I suddenly realized what I was saying. Cultural relevance. I mean, why should this post be relevant? Well, look at the description. It said, "Talk about cultural relevance."\n\nSo now, here we are, just talking about cultural relevance, and guess what? I just realized that in\n"

I was still in a fog, and knew it was going to be a very busy day, so I decided to be quiet, lie in the bed, and try to relax for a while.\n\nIn a short time, I heard the dog’s greeting bark, I looked at the clock, and saw that it was already 11am. I was a little upset that I didn’t go to bed until almost 9, but I knew that by 11am, the kids would already be awake, ready to go to school.\n\n“That’s fine,” I thought, “They have school, I have a job. I can do this.”\n\nI showered and got dressed, and realized I had a lot of packing to do in order to leave for work. Packing happens pretty early in the morning, when it’s still dark outside, but as the sky started to brighten, I started to feel a little more peaceful, and more relaxed.\n\nI got in my car, and started to drive to work. On my way, I saw a lady at the corner of my street. She was walking in a really tired manner, as if she was on her way to her bed, and was ready to go to sleep.\n\nShe looked just like me.\n\nThis made me think that we all have to start early sometimes.\n\nIt’s easy to feel sad when you wake up very early in the morning, but you can do nothing about it. It’s better to start the day with happiness, because by the end of the day, it’s really easy to feel bad about yourself.\n\nIt’s good to start the day with a good mind, to be in a good mood, and be cheerful.\n\nWe can’t always choose to wake up early in the morning, but we can choose to wake up feeling good, and be ready for the day.\n\nThis lady wasn’t happy. She had a lot of worries in her mind, and she was carrying a heavy backpack full of worries.\n\nShe was a bag lady.\n\nShe didn’t know how she was going to make her next meal, and she wasn’t going to make\n"

We don’t take the time to step back and ask, “What have I learned today?” To change that, we must start by looking in the mirror, examining what we do each and every day, and paying attention to how it impacts us and those around us.\n\nWe asked a few of our friends to share stories of how life has taught them to be more humble. These lessons aren’t just lessons to “be humble”—these are lessons in life that we can all learn from.\n\nKari Lynn Leonard on the Future\n\nIt’s not that I’ve changed in the last few months, it’s that I’ve learned to accept that I’m not perfect. I didn’t believe that I could change until I saw myself from another person’s perspective. I’m still on my journey and I still have work to do, but this has opened my eyes. I’m more optimistic and I’ve learned to be happy with my situation. This quote has been my mantra for a while, “Live a life of thankfulness, and every day, as if you’re living not your own life but the life you deserve.”– James Dean\n\nWe asked Kari, “What has life taught you?” She replied, “I learned to be grateful for the gifts that I’ve been given and be happier.”\n\nShe also explained what inspired her to write that quote, saying, “I read an article in The Washington Post about a young girl who had a message for her children and so she wrote down the quote, and then she found a place to say the quote and I love it. I think it’s wonderful because it teaches us to live a life of thankfulness. And to be happy, to be the best you, which is hard sometimes, but you just have to be thankful for what you have, you have everything you need to be a great person. You’re living the life you deserve, even if it’s not always good. I know I’m working on that.”\n\nHere’s what she told us about where she’s at:\n\n“I am happier, I think, because I don’t pretend that I’m\n"

(Robert Frost)\n\nMain menu\n\nMonthly Archives: May 2016\n\n“Children are still children and should not be working in the hospitality industry,” says Mahesh Singh, whose three children have never met their grandparents in India because he lives in Canada. His children, aged 11, 6 and 3, earn extra money by selling desserts and coffee drinks to people at local coffee shops in the Maple Grove area of Minneapolis.\n\nThe centre of the town has a few coffee shops with a convenience store inside where a line of parents and grandparents wait for their children and grandchildren. There are no educational, workplace or health and safety requirements in the industry and only 1 in 12 children are trained. The bakery itself is a small business with no child protection training, sign or kitchen equipment. There are no written policies and there are no child labor laws in Minnesota.\n\nYoung children, often immigrants with little English, use public transportation to travel to the shops to work. Some adults become abusive to the children, slapping them in the face when they refuse to pick up customers fast enough and in turn, the children are afraid to tell their parents.\n\nIn 2014, a nine-year old child died in a Minnesota grocery store after he was assaulted by a cashier. “I could not accept this,” says Singh. “I had to work all the time and could not be available to take care of my children.” Singh had to leave his family, but he was fortunate to get a job working for a local non-profit. His hours are flexible and he has been able to spend more time with his children. He now regularly speaks to youth in his neighborhood and community about children and their rights.\n\nSingh hopes for the day when there will be government regulations and inspections to help young children avoid working in the hospitality industry. He would also like to see safe work conditions for children in bakeries. The families are not making a lot of money, but it is enough for his children to eat and have clothes. He wants the job to be more transparent so that he can know if any issues arise.\n\nThe little boy sits in the seat beside the window in the middle seat of the bus.

Helen Keller, abandoned at birth, spent most of her life communicating her thoughts and emotions to no one, her family, and her world by her hands. She was uneducated and could not read and write, but she learned to speak in spite of not being able to hear. At age 7, her teacher placed a glass of water on the floor and asked, “What’s that?”\n\nHer teacher made her deaf, and this prevented the girl from hearing the teacher’s response: “Nothing.” With a bewildered and angered face, Helen picked up the water, threw it to the wall, and angrily exclaimed, “It IS something!”\n\nMost of us understand the full implications of that little story, but no one has a clear understanding of the full implications of the name the girl gave the object in the story. Let’s talk about the word “water” for a few minutes.\n\n“Water” is a two-word noun composed of a term for the object the word refers to and the name of the thing the object is. It’s as easy to name “the dog in the living room” as it is to name “the object being used to gather an apple from a tree” or “the apple being picked.” The word “water” would seem to be similarly simple: “water” is the object and “water” is the name of the object.\n\nBut in reality the word “water” isn’t so simple. The term “water” is nothing like “apple,” but neither does it refer to the word itself in the same way as “apple” does. The word “water” is a term for the thing water is. It’s similar to the word “meter” in that way: The term “meter” is a term for the thing meters are, and the word “meter” is a name for the thing meters are. But the term “meter” is nothing like the word “meter,” just as the term “water” is nothing like the word “water.” The term “water” isn’t the water, the water is the term “water.”\n\nMost people’s understanding of this fact\n"

I can’t think about her now, because I might have the strength to mourn what she did to my world.\n\nI can’t bring her into the kind of existential crisis I’m facing. I have to turn back, I have to face the storm. The memories overwhelm me. I’m a different person now. I can’t find my way into her pain and her life and her dying.

The world is full of trials and tribulations, so just try things, see if they work out, and move on. If they do work out, well you get to do what you do and be who you are. If they don’t work out, there’s still learning along the way. As Charles Bukowski put it, “To hell with what you think. And I mean to hell with what everybody else thinks. And I don’t care what you say, what everybody else says, or what you think or what anybody else thinks. To hell with what you think.” You’ve got to find what works and keep on keeping on.\n\nThe best thing about working out is working in the freedom to be you. You’re not obligated to do what the “experts” say you should do, or what everybody else does. No matter how far you progress in the sport, you can continue to get better in the freedom to be yourself. I could spend the rest of my life complaining about not being able to get to a certain height, or being uncomfortable when a pull up to a chin up gets the hips out of position. It wouldn’t matter what I’m saying or what I’m doing, if I stay that way it will eventually limit my potential. What are the best competitors in the world doing differently? They’re taking their respective sports and finding a way to excel in the freedom to be themselves. It’s not easy, it’s not something you can control, but if you can’t keep the body you’ve got now you might as well end it now.\n\nThe more you work in the freedom to be yourself the more your body will change for the better. Yes, it will take a little more time than just listening to the “experts” but trust me, there’s so much more to working out than a fast five mile run. It’s more than throwing around weight and sitting on the couch while you drink beer. As long as you are training hard you will eventually see improvement, it just may take time and it might not happen for you. If I’m honest with you, I don’t think there is a specific way to get in shape or stay in shape.\n"

The spot's imagery brings back great memories of Chris Mann's spin-tandem loader back in the early 80's.\n\nFor the past couple of years, one of our tractor brands, Case, has sponsored the award winning Wheel Loader Magazine's video series. For the third edition of the "How it's made" series, Case selected a winner to build a trailer. The winning trailer was built by Andy Lane of Muncie, Indiana.\n\nTwo trailers: two different approaches.\n\nOur group on the Case website was looking for an idea that captured the essence of Case's two-wheel-drives (TWD) line of vehicles. It also had to reflect Case's overall product vision and position.\n\nThe one, fun, product that came to mind, took a look at the TR-3 and concluded that the ride height was low, the ride quality was outstanding, and the ability to roll over obstacles was superior to a wheeled loader. He then decided that these were the features he needed to exploit and create a real product. He determined that the aesthetics of the TR-3 did not fit into the brand. So he turned to other ways to accomplish the above goals. He created a towed trailer and a pulled trailer.\n\nThis third trailer, built to do the work, not look good, fits the brand, and will help Case become the undisputed leader in the two-wheel drive market. A new breed of Case driver is being born.\n\nSaturday, July 1, 2008\n\nWe were the highest ranked show in the Ford Division - winning Best of Show!This was the second time in three years we were able to sweep the three divisions we compete in.

The group was originally established as the genus Rostrhamus, by James Hutton in 1825, but the group was later split up and moved around. At present, the genus Rostrhamus contains just one species: Elanus americanus.\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\nThe black-shouldered kite lives throughout the north of Australia, and throughout southern and eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania. It can be found in more arid habitats than most other members of its group, and can even be found in wetlands in arid areas, such as Australia's Simpson Desert, but is uncommon in tropical rainforest.\n\nIts range encompasses arid habitats, as well as subtropical, tropical, and temperate zones. It is the only member of its genus to have been recorded breeding in a rainforest, and the third Elanus to have bred in a tropical rainforest, after the other two species that have been confirmed to breed in rainforests: Elanus dauricus and Elanus niger. Rainforests may be the only place that the black-shouldered kite can be found in large numbers, as it prefers open habitats, and prefers areas with a lower canopy density than many of its relatives. It may nest in the high canopy of tropical rainforest, and is found at high densities in some wetland areas.\n\nHowever, not all rainforest areas that this bird has been seen have had good habitats in which it could have thrived, as the black-shouldered kite is often found in areas that have been degraded, as it prefers open areas with access to plenty of food, water, and shelter.\n\nThreats\n\nThe black-shouldered kite is not threatened by many of the same threats that\n"

It has been released theatrically in some countries in stereophonic and laser-disc soundtracks and more recently in 3D. It has also been released on VHS, Beta, laser disc, DVD, Blu-ray, HD DVD, and digital video, among other formats. The film was added to the Disney/Pixar Collection, a digital platform developed by Disney that allows people to watch films in theaters, on television and on personal video players, as well as download it. The film was also shown in the first Mickey Mouse Club TV broadcast.\n\nDisney also developed the first Mickey Mouse Club TV show, which premiered in October 1955. The show lasted for only one season, but the Mickey Mouse Club became a huge success, with 35 million viewers watching the first episode. The show was aired in various countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Australia and Italy, to great acclaim. It also paved the way for the success of later TV shows such as The Cosby Show and Boy Meets World, which showcased characters and concepts developed during the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIn 1953, Disney created another spin-off film series, which became known as the Silly Symphonies series.\n\nDisney also created Mickey's Christmas Carol, which was first released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1987 and is now available on DVD and Blu-ray. It was the first original movie from Disney since the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. It was also released in IMAX and 3D. Mickey's Christmas Carol has been viewed by over 140 million people worldwide and was nominated for a BAFTA Award and an Emmy. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and won a World Stunt Awards Award in 2005 for best family film.

We spend about 20 minutes a day just with ours. Sometimes we go with it and ride the horses, sometimes we just sit and pet them, and sometimes we take them for walks and enjoy the time we spend with them.\n\nYes, all the time spent in these ways could be deemed as being an activity that we are doing, however, we feel we get far more reward from them than if we go out and do some kind of regular activity that we usually do for money and entertainment. The most important reward of all, at least for me, is the time spent being out in nature, being quiet and content without the distraction of activities.\n\nSometimes we may take some video of them and watch them later or enjoy looking at them on the computer. We also spend a lot of time looking at them for sale. It is pretty much a hobby for us.\n\nNot all the time does our time with them count as time we are doing any kind of "work" activity. You know the kind of activities that will make money. We would include these kinds of activities as going to work. When we go riding we are doing a work activity as we are using the horse as a vehicle to carry us somewhere. While on a walk with our horses we are still working as we are going somewhere using a different kind of vehicle as a foot, but when we spend time with them, we are not working at all and we are not thinking about the time passing or even doing anything else as we enjoy the time we are spending with them.\n\nShould we count this time spent with our horses as work as being the kind of activity we would generally do in a job that might make us money? Not in our case.\n\nBy the way, I have decided that this site and all its various pages is now our business and as a business we are trying to make money from it.

This period also saw the development of transformational grammar, with its successors, transformational syntactic analysis and transformational functional grammar. From about 1935 to 1945, the USSR developed its own system of structuralism, known as the Moscow school. After the Prague school split in 1948, the structuralist movement effectively was split in two: while structuralism in France was named "structuralism" and became an important branch of the general trend of European structuralism, in the Soviet Union, "structuralism" was simply functional grammar, which in turn was severely constrained by the doctrine of linguistics put forward by the Moscow school.\n\nThe structuralism of the French schools could be termed object-oriented linguistics and tended to do syntax primarily from the point of view of morphology, or (in French) morphologique.\n\nIn his "discovery" of the patterns that govern the distribution of elements and subelements in the sentence (syntagm), Lucien Tesnière was an influential early proponent of "functionalist" or "situationalist" linguistics and a precursor of morphologique.[4] Both the language of Le Guin and French structural linguistics are intended to be narrations, rather than descriptions, of situations and are concerned with the enactment of the events, rather than with the analysis of abstract forms and grammatical functions. This pragmatic understanding of syntax was influential in the development of French structuralism, along with Tesnière's work, the theory of syntax, founded by Noam Chomsky and incorporated by Lucien Tesnière and several others, was a part of it. They drew the theory of syntax from functional analysis, the corpus and the syntagma.\n\nThe Prague school initially followed Tesnière's direction but developed a more innovative methodology. In Prague, structuralism was mainly the object-oriented approach, where the main research focus was on syntax, semantics, and semantics-pragmatics. The Prague school was primarily devoted to the investigation of syntactic systems. There was a difference in the Prague school between descriptive and prescriptive linguistics.\n\nMoscow school was a Russian grammatical school influenced by the Prague School and the Parisian structuralism (especially Ferdinand de Saussure). The Moscow school was the first to declare linguistics to be a systematic science. The Moscow school was interested in the new, emerging linguistic sciences, like sociolinguistics, statistical linguistics and psychology, but not in new methodology, at least for the time\n"
"56"|"The Beatles and the Merseybeat sound ."|"in the 1960s, The Beatles and the Merseybeat sound began to dominate the Dutch charts, which led to interest among Dutch musicians in forming bands that perform such music, replacing a previous genre Indorock which was performed by immigrants. These musicians included Biddy King, Bruno Hartmann, Martin Gertig, Gerard Endtz, Marga Scheide, Pierre Goossens, Taco Meincke and Martin Plaza. The genre formed under the Dutch name of "Lydpop" (local music). In 1976, the first Dutch festival was held in Helmond. In 1980, the first rock festival, Rock in de Donker in Arnhem was held, and in 1981 the first Dutch Eurovision Song Contest was held in Arnhem.\n\nThe term "lidpop" entered the Dutch dictionary in 1990. It means pop music with a Dutch accent. Since the early 1990s, it became increasingly popular among pop musicians in the Netherlands. During the same period, bands such as Fixx, The Gathering, De Staat, and Goldfish emerged from the general lydpop genre.

"57"|"The Alexandra Line"|"The Alexandra Line was a short branch line in Victoria, Australia, that connected with the Mansfield railway line at Cathkin.\n\nHistory\nThe Alexandra Line was originally constructed by the Melbourne and St Kilda Railway (M&StKR), which opened the line from Hawthorn to St Kilda on 20 October 1868. The line ran from the M&StKR's present-day eastern terminal in St Kilda East, through the suburb of Melbourne via St Kilda Junction, along the current-day Tullamarine Freeway, St Kilda Road, High Street, Fitzroy Street, Swanston Street, Russell Street, St Kilda Junction, to St Kilda East. In 1890, a branch was opened from Fitzroy Street, St Kilda to Alexandra Parade, and the line became the Elwood Railway (later the Puffing Billy Railway) on 1 July 1891. In 1908, M&StKR became part of the Melbourne and Gawler Railway Company (M&G), becoming the third-largest subsidiary of the company (after the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works and the Public Transport Board).\n\nIn July 1916, the construction of the Alexandra Freeway, along with other road projects, was instrumental in the purchase of the line by the Victorian Railways in 1918. After World War I, the line was renamed the Alexandra Line and passenger services began on 24 August 1919. In 1924, the Melbourne and St Kilda railway closed for financial reasons.\n\nOn 17 October 1937, as part of the standardisation process of the railway system under the Public Transport Act 1912, control of the M&StKR passed from the Public Transport Board to the state government. As a result, the line passed under the control of the Victorian Railways. In 1968, the Melburn and Gawler Railway Company merged into the Victorian Railways. The line was still named the Alexandra Line, and the route was standardised and mostly duplicated by the first Y-trains in 1976.\n\nThe line continued to be operated under the banner of the Victorian Railways until 1980, when the State Rail Authority took over the operation of public transport. In 1987, the line was in a state of neglect, and the Royal Flying Doctor Service was considering replacing the line with an airport rail link.\n\nOn 29 October 1987, the State Government announced the construction of the Hume Highway and West Gate Freeway. It was later announced that the West Gate Freeway would be built using the Yarra River route, and the line was closed on 29 September 1991.

Early rupestre clade species in other families (e.g. Malva, Caltha) show a "long stick" form (phyllody) and a "twiggy" form (gamophylly), respectively. Our study shows that both types occur in the early rupestre clade as well, and that these variants are very frequent, and can even dominate in the field. They differ in their shoot morphology, with the gamophytic form being twiggy (and frequently having apical dimorphism) and the phyllodioid form possessing stout, often woody shoots. Molecular data support that the gamophytic and phyllodioid forms are monophyletic. Interspecific reticulate hybridization may occur between phyllodioid forms of the gamophytic species. In contrast to studies of related species in the past, our work shows that in the rupestre group two morphs (gamophytic and phyllodioid) may occur in the early rupestre clade. There is little evidence for reproductive isolation between the two variants of phyllodioid form, despite the high number of shoot forms of C. eburnea.<endoftext>News\n\nMyers back in touch with court after receiving 2 year suspended sentence for drunk driving\n\nA TRAVEL AGENT from Myers Road, Ellesmere Port has been back in touch with his former employers after being given a two year suspended sentence for drink driving.\n\nJeffrey Woolley was involved in a fatal collision with a van driven by a man from Uppermill, Bootle, on Holy Island, Anglesey, in August last year.

Alas, fate conspired against her, and killed her, before she had ever been fed. Or so the Unknowable told her.\n\nSighing, she managed to stand up, having propped herself up against the stone wall. Standing, she saw her companion lying next to her, also unconscious. Outside, the sun beat down on her burning face.

Closing the pouch, she gently pushed it back under the uniform. From her jacket pocket, she pulled out a cigarette, and let it die in her mouth, exhaling smoke in the air as she closed her eyes.\n\nSniffling, she thought of her soldier friend, but she could not remember his name, for they had not actually been introduced. Since it was common for enlisted personnel to be left behind, she couldn't imagine what happened to him, although there were rumours that a monster had gotten him. She did not really care.

They said we are in a “republic” – meaning of equal “shareholders” and not “shareholder rights.”\n\nThis is an age where there are not many good ideas, just a lot of bad ones and a lot of assholes who want to take credit for the good ones. Now I want to look at the history of Harvard. It has a long history and we will not get into that here, but Harvard was a part of the “Royal Colony” – The British Empire. The British Empire was the first to put a decent system in place – majority of the civilized world’s empire was run by “constitutional monarchs” (Monarchy, House of Orange, House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, House of Windsor, House of Hanover, House of Hohenzollern, House of Habsburg, House of Hapsburg, House of House of Liechtenstein, House of Nassau and House of Orange). The European monarchies were tied to the British House of Windsor and had no significant independent powers.\n\nSo our Founding Fathers went to Harvard to learn what the best system is to organize a “republic”? So we can do it right? They do not learn that. To learn that the right to vote is THE most important thing. At that time all the Founders knew that slaves could vote and half the population could not vote. Well when the year 1776 rolled around that rule was still there – so the “better” system was adopted by the British Empire. A whole new set of laws were passed and “enforced” on the slaves to keep them from voting, because once slaves got the vote they would vote republican. (The irony of that is that the slaves knew the difference between a monarch and a republic – what is supposed to be a bad thing, becomes a good thing – the rule of law is followed and not the rule of the mob – genius.)\n\nThe Founding Fathers did not go to Harvard to be organized into a system that takes the voice of the people away – they learned something else in their time at Harvard.

A drive from coast to coast across the United States in a new, carbon-free vehicle, driven entirely by solar power.\n\nI'm driving my kids to the mall and using some real fossil fuels to get there. -Juris\n\nWhat I love about this is that it demonstrates what is possible. I'm still skeptical that everyone will drive a 100% electric vehicle, but I'm impressed that technology exists that allows a person to cross the country in a carbon-free vehicle.\n\nNot only is this proof of what is possible, but it's proof that a small change in our everyday lives can have a big effect on the environment, one small step at a time.\n\nEver since I learned to drive, I've wanted to have a car, but I've always thought that they were much more trouble than they're worth. There are some things I'd like to be able to have in my house, and a car isn't one of them, but I know I can do the math. I'd save a TON of money, and I would use the additional money to go on more adventure vacations and donate some to good causes. And, honestly, most of the time, it just seems like it's one of those things that I shouldn't have because it's too inconvenient.\n\nBut this man drove across the United States in a solar electric car. A car he could have owned if he hadn't felt guilty about the fact that it takes natural resources to make a car, and natural resources are finite. The vehicle is 100% carbon-free, and he didn't even have to take the car out of the garage and drive it to work! This car could have replaced my air conditioning (but we don't have air conditioning in my house) if I hadn't wanted to use it. But it's a carbon-free car that gets plenty of sunlight all the way from Oregon to California. It cost me less than $15 a day to drive across the United States. All I had to do was drive at a steady pace, and let the solar power supply me.\n\nI don't mean to say that you shouldn't have a car. I've found that cars are pretty much indispensable for me to get to where I want to go. Having\n"

I.\n\nForthwith, though vaunting, thy mother appeared to be a devil, accursed to bear for ever such a lineal perdition of two generations.\n\nWhen the Angel had finished his ministry, one of the Fathers with a wicked and subtle purpose said unto him: "Behold thy godly mother-in-law, I ween, have tarried long in vain, and we may peradventure go thither to seek her out; peradventure her malice may entertain us." Another there was, a bold, hardy, indefatigable and malicious man, somewhat older than the rest, who, for the first, took upon him to do valiantly, and provoked in him the envy of his fellows, who began to revile him from that time, having occasion, for the first time, to fall upon their knees. Nevertheless this old man persisted to persecute, for the first time, those that reviled him, and grew daily the bolder, his fierceness being gone. When the other Fathers (or servants of the Church, or priests, as some call them) had left the apparition of the Angel, and when none remained, with one consent the whole multitude were pressing and running to one side. At that time, the great doors that fronted the inner side of the Chapel opened suddenly of themselves, and there appeared a great bright light: and when those who were there before the Angel saw this sudden and prodigal opening of the doors, they believed it was the special ministry of the Angel that those doors should open so suddenly, and the natural order of the doors to open of themselves so suddenly. And the father who looked to the more immediate goal, following the motion and fidget of the company, did not go in, but stay behind for fear of the door, to wait for his companions. The old man also, who was standing upon the steps, presently retired with the rest to a place at the entry. Then the doors being opened on the inside, there came forth in a fine, clear, unspeakable light (as it seemed) Jesus, who had appeared in the same manner as the angel, crying, "Behold my mother!" At that sudden appearance of the angel's light all (those who saw it) were dazzled with a most exquisite and most precious light. And even some of them could\n"

The mod was even designed to use that aesthetic, and there are some elements. Now, the element that lets it flip its own genre is the changing of the weapon and ammo.\n\nGuns today, and yesterday have a amount of bullets and so on a gun is not really a machine. We're speaking of a lot of little components. From the steel to the firing mechanism. And what is the way the ammo is stored. There are many ways to reload it. So the ammo includes the box for it and the bullet box. But some gun are smaller and they load faster, so they just have the bullet box, with the bullets embedded in it. These are the limited bullets. This type of ammunition is not reloadable. The means this.50 caliber or.45 caliber is used in modern war nowadays. So these limited bullet has all kinds of damage because it's the only thing that fires. However the unique bullets, which is a ammunition and actually shot, that we use for a specific function.

In the same Field where his Ambition, Ambition of another, and his Temper are trying their Match, and where to succeed, they are to stand in Competition. As many good Qualities as he displays, he is to share them, and undergo the same Adversity as those he courts. He is to be angry, for a considerable Time, at what he has long been provoked to resent. He has exposed himself to Enemies, and all that can be done to ruin him, may be done; his King being in the wrong, he should be able to bear the first Offence.

For, if we are told that, on other Accounts, they may approve him, we may conclude he does not owe that Regard to them; or at least has some other Cause to think otherwise than they do; and if he does it on account of his Virtue, if they shall find that it is his first and only Desire, there is something in him more than Human, which is a Character very unlike the Vice we mention.

You must see this gigantic and horrible creature hold up his arms in a gesture of despair and depression; then see him suddenly gash his throat with a blow of his fist, and which hand has such strength that in the jaws of the monster, the blow finds and breaks the cuneiform. By this break he slips into the sea, and he will now plunge into the deep sea, where he falls upon the Scylla that is in the water, and that will devour him. But let us return to the realities of the tale. What can the Scylla do? It would be impossible for her to tear him from the monster's arms, it would be impossible for her to give him time to cut the fetters that tie him; he has just cut himself loose from Charybdis. Scylla says nothing; she is simply startled, she raises her arms, makes a movement to tear at the net, at the cord that attaches the monster to Charybdis. The monster perceives her movement, he turns himself toward her and she sees him, but the huge creature with great arms raises his immense hands over Scylla's head to seize her by the hair, and he draws her toward him by her hair.\n\nThat which would prevent her from being swallowed by Charybdis is his hair, and the more Scylla struggles, the more she approaches Charybdis, who grows in strength. The monster is sometimes more powerful than Scylla, and then he roars at her and makes her tremble. In vain she strives. She rises to her feet, her hair does not hold, the monster grasps it with his two enormous hands; but Scylla springs upon him, and breaks with one blow his cuneiform. The monster sinks into the waves, Scylla still pursuing him. She would return to shore, but before she reaches land, the monster is already upon her, and he suddenly\n"

The\nDuke of Burgundy occupied the right hand of the King, his Marechal\nd'Estampes was on his left, and the King of Portugal on the King's\nright, _behind_.

Meanwhile, the young Pushkin takes up residence in Moscow with his brother Vladimir and there he meets Catherine Druzhinin who persuades him to write a series of letters to the Empress as a way of communicating with the Empress. The proposal is approved and Pushkin writes daily reports from January 1801 to October 1801. The letters are then read out loud to Catherine Fyodorovna every evening before bed. Pushkin writes to her of his friendship with Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin who then publishes the letters under the title Letters from the Underworld.\n\nSarov likes nothing better than having people suffer.

The Queen was Felipe II and through him the Order honors Mary I, King Philip II, Queen Elizabeth I of England and King Felipe III of Spain.\n\nPresent Day\n\nThe Order today, is the most widely known of the Orders, and its presence is felt all over the world.  Amongst the 27,000 surviving "Noble Castilians", over 22,000 are currently living in Spain; nearly 3,000 abroad in 114 countries and territories.  From those, about 15,000 represent over 25,000 alumni who are actively carrying out works of service.\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation\n\nThe Order of Saint Francis de Paula was founded on March 19, 1568, in the Convent of St. Clare in Seville. The founder of the order was King Philip II of Spain, who signed the Royal Charter granting its constitutions. The first Superior General of the order was the Bishop of Burgos, then Archbishop of Seville, Francisco Montoro (1568–1574). Montoro dedicated himself to the care of the sick in hospitals and in 1567 and was already granted permission by the King to establish a charitable society to care for poor people, which was legally recognized in 1568. He died in 1574 and was succeeded by Bishop Diego de Zuñiga.\n\nFirst Superior General\n\nAt the death of Bishop Montoro, it was determined that the order would be governed by a Superior General (Capitan General) who would be chosen by the General Chapter, which met for the first time in 1575. In this chapter, Bishop Zuñiga was elected. The first years of the Superior General’s term of office were very difficult, because the Reformation that had begun in the reign of Philip II and a certain degree of disobedience to the Bishop began to be noticeable. To this end, the Duke of Alba, who had become the viceroy in 1568, and the Inquisitor-General, Torquemada, used various means to keep the Catholic forces under control. The author of the biography of the Order maintains that the creation of the order was part of this struggle. Despite this opposition, the Order and its members continued in their activities with the support of the Superior General.\n\nDuring this\n"

In his Life of Roger Ascham we find only, that after the return of Ascham from France to England, in 1528, he went to see him there, upon the occasion of his being forced to leave this country, which was sent him by his majesty to return home, the King having found out that the doctrine of the French Protestants was largely propagated in England. This, however, was after his return to England. At the same time it happened that Robert Aske, esquire, whom he had encouraged for a time with good will, at last had been compelled by the terror of the late Scottish invasion to fly into Scotland, where he presently so had incurred the suspicion of his majesty that he was in the company of the Queen of Scots.\n\nFrom a Relation which Mr. Stow, in his Annals, that compiled by him in the year 1613, has, of a curious man, who took this man's will to the execution of it, the following account of his death is contained; viz. —\n\n"The day that Henry Machyn came from France, was one of the last dayes of the feast of St. Barnard's. (The name was, some time after, changed to Blonde Rookheath.) The servants of Robert, esquire, informed his majesty of it, and he being sudden in his mind (as was given out), wrote a letter to the king of Scots, of which his majesty,\n"

In his twelve years there he was constantly occupied in literary composition, and assisted the principal in the preparation of that work, which has become the great standard work of ancient literature. The Prince Mahomed Chelebi gave him his freedom, and employed him in various important missions to the Sublime Porte. But as soon as Damaskinos presented himself at his Court, his talents were in vain exerted to obtain a considerable office. He then transferred his talents to the portico of St. Sophia, the picture gallery and bookbinderies, a project which in all his later vicissitudes never forsook him. His earliest works were these, a treatise on this and that subject, in the modern Persian language, an Edition of which appeared in London and Paris, 1792. This was received with applause, and such as used to do him the honour of their personal visits, were assured of the merit of his efforts. After this he published one of his own comedies, in verse. He was offered the professorship of the Latin Language at the Imperial College, but his strong and tenacious taste for truth (so common in men of genius) induced him to remain at the Court; a circumstance which made a great noise, as the intelligence was in high favour at the time. Afterwards he took a diploma in literature. He is also celebrated for the valuable works which he wrote on the Turkish language; all of which are not only delightful to read, but important to science, inasmuch as they are a faithful history of that Oriental tongue. While he was in the service of the Sultan, he composed various works to the Great Chereish and the Great Seckchid, which he had the honour of presenting personally to both.\n\nHe thus passed through every grade, and enjoyed the enjoyment of all the favours to which he attained. He was a Minister of State, an envoy extraordinary to France, and was Ambassador to the King of France; but the mission to the Sublime Porte, although he was honoured with the appointment, was not accepted.\n\n"

These Men, as one may say, are Persons of an over-nice Importance; and they lay up nothing, but what may serve for the Service of their Lives, or the Necessities of their Well being; their Necessaries being all, what a poor Thing they are, to suppose themselves able to maintain, while they are out of the City.

It is no Wonder that a Man in an Abatement of Spirits, should often be very troublesome, and sometimes very ridiculous; but he becomes a Subject of Entertainment to all who visit him, when he is perfectly sober and justly temperate.

"Come on, boy," Lancewood calls to it, with not much optimism. The horse tries to prance off with its nose in the air, reluctant to be turned back, but as he moves closer to take hold of the reins to guide it, his leg comes into contact with the half-spent load and the pair of them nearly go down.

In 1671, he returned to America, where he pursued business as a printer, writing a successful almanac in 1682. In 1690, Franklin and Peter Collinson opened America’s first printing office, and in 1701, Franklin purchased a one-third interest in the Philadelphia Gazette.\n\nIn 1723, Franklin wrote the Poor Richard’s Almanac, a humorous annual in which the author attempted to summarize and improve on the general state of the American colonies. His work, A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency, appeared in 1729. This marked the beginning of Franklin’s status as a great political pamphleteer, and he continued to write many political and scientific works over the next few decades.\n\nIn 1732, Franklin was chosen to represent Pennsylvania in the 1733 Constitutional Assembly in Albany. In 1757, he was chosen to represent Philadelphia in the First Continental Congress, where he served as America’s primary delegate.

He, in the meantime, perceiving by the respect and silence of his company, that they would not, or could not meet his arguments, took the book out of his hand, and opened it towards Sir Urian; and told him, that he might make use of it in reading over the argument he had used in that room, if he pleased, to him; and in writing it too; to which Sir Urian consented, and undertook it, according to the conditions of the author, by the mediation of Sir Frederick Langdale, knight. And Sir Hildebrand having returned to his own house, was present, and observed the motion Sir Urian made there, to scratch over the word created, in this passage, to which Sir Hildebrand proposed, if Sir Urian would spare him the labour of reading it over, to write the word over again; and that word was, man: which Sir Urian would do himself, if Sir Hildebrand would allow him the use of his pen.

A pretty pretty figure was my young friend as he danced with a rosy, bewitching Blanche.\n\nJust then, my ear caught the sound of a voice at a distance, and I fancied I heard the voice of Captain Frederick Montmorenci, whom I had just left alone, ill, and in want of my most active assistance. Instantly I rose, without intending to draw any notice upon myself, and went into the antechamber to see if I could help him. I discovered, through the glass door, the two dancers just where he had left them, dancing a mazurka. I recognized the voice as that of Blanche. A lover, who, from his voice, seemed to be also a foreigner, mingled his languishing glances with hers, as she stood on a stile listening to him, while she kept her hands concealed in the folds of her dress. I became very jealous, for this man seemed to be winning the heart of the Countess.\n\nI watched them; and my indignation and anger boiled within me when I saw that they were more discomposed than before, and that this ridiculous minuet was affecting them.\n\n"How little they think of their prince," I said to myself. "We may do more than dance, Monsieur Frederick! We may carry them back to their beds." And I followed them through the postern, into the garden.\n\nAt the sound of the door shutting, the lovers ceased dancing, and all three looked toward the new-comer.

All in all, not a bad way to spend a winter's evening, but the light in this county is just what it always is, hazy, white, gray, and more cold and wet than anything I can remember. I saw the most astounding thing tonight. I was standing on the pile of logs which had been moved out of the 'edge' of the fire to make a fresh start for the night, and I had just taken off my clothes, when I heard the crackle of small arms fire, very faint, as if in the distance. I turned my head, and stared, and there in the mist ahead of me, five or six yards away, I could see the body of a man, standing as still as a sentinel, his rifle cocked, his finger on the trigger. I could see his features plainly; a massive head and a big, wide face, with a bump of a nose, a small mouth, and an open, quizzical expression of most incongruous, of I don't know what. He stood there, as he had done for I suppose an hour or more, this man, in that place, with his rifle in his hands. What I didn't see was any enemy; no other man, or any vehicle on the road. The night was quiet. I stepped toward him, and began, as usual, to be careful of him. He was dressed in the uniform of a U. S. Army soldier. He was tall, very tall; but his height made him appear slight, and he looked thin and almost gaunt. He must have weighed about 140 or 150 pounds, his shoulder-muscle was apparent; he was dressed in a uniform, in faded and dirty blue.\n\nNear him was a big red automobile with a black top; I couldn't see the numbers. He kept a white, finger-shaped dust-stain in his right eye. There were rags tied over the gas-jets. The engine stopped. The windows were up. The fog was so thick that I could not see him. I stepped toward the car; he did not move. I stepped on to the car and looked at him. There he was, standing a few feet away, like an illustration from a\n"

He studied Architecture at the University of Madras and graduated with a degree in the same field.\n\nHe is one of the few Indians who hold two master's degrees. He holds both the degrees of Master of Architecture (MArch) and Master of Industrial Design (MID) from the University of Minnesota.\n\nIn 2016, he married Chetana Venkatakrishnan and the couple has two daughters - Kaavya and Anushka.<endoftext>In recent years, attention has been focused on the environment conservation, and automotive internal combustion engines have also started to be equipped with a device to emit nitrogen oxide into the air to meet the standard of the air pollution prevention. For instance, a new catalytic converter called HC-SCR (HC stands for hydrocarbon, and SCR stands for Selective Catalytic Reduction) has been studied in which a precious metal such as platinum is supported on a porous support with high porosity and filled in a device called catalyst vessel. In this catalyst vessel, the exhaust gas passes through the fine pores of the support to contact the precious metal. HC is oxidized on the surface of the precious metal, and thus, the nitrogen oxide contained in the exhaust gas is converted to nitrogen and water vapor with the aid of the hydrocarbon.\nThe precious metal has a normal potential of around 1.4 V, and therefore, the support with high porosity with which the precious metal is loaded is required to have a low resistance at the normal potential of the precious metal. Furthermore, the support is preferably have a high degree of structural stability even in a high temperature range to achieve a long lifespan for the precious metal. However, it is difficult to acquire both the low resistance at the normal potential of the precious metal and the high structural stability.\nAs a method to achieve the low resistance at the normal potential of the precious metal, there is a method to coat the surface of a support with a catalyst carrier or a catalyst material having a high resistance to oxidation. However, the method increases the size of a catalyst layer, so that the space for the precious metal to contact the exhaust gas is decreased. In this method, therefore, the nitrogen oxide is difficult to be converted, and the conversion efficiency of the nitrogen oxide is low.\n"

But as my life has descended into madness, I've been pretty active in what the Russians are up to. Between Kaggle and Quora I've tried to keep my head about me, and have managed to get to the bottom of the fake rocket attacks on Damascus and Lebanon a few days ago. I've tried to do some more SDR and Skype, but it really can't be when you're trying to write a post.\n\nMeanwhile the information you need to get an understanding of Russia's problems is also in the news. If you're not up to speed you should check out the BBC's bbc.com and the Telegraph's blogs. As an ex-pat I've stayed fairly close to my Russian friends, who are trying to get a handle on things.\n\nHere's my quick summary, with references and further reading:\n\nEver since Russia joined the EU Russia's been dragged in to disputes between the EU, Turkey, and Poland. I expect there's little future in that as it's just an internal quarrel between the East and West. However, in trying to put a lid on this (and consolidate power domestically) Putin decided to veto the Russian-EU Treaty, and sit down to talk things out with Turkey. The result of which is this clash between Moscow, Ankara, and Brussels, and some pretty serious rumbling in the Middle East.\n\nFor Russia, the impact of all this is having the ability to intervene as effectively as they can in a dispute between the EU, and Poland, Turkey, and the United States. They've even toyed with the idea of a EU-Russia-Asia-African troika, where the EU would take the (British) Mediterranean route, and Russia the route through Siberia. Russia is no longer interested in the old Brezhnev days of being a buffer state, and seems to be looking to increase its power. I'll detail what that means in a future post.\n\nMeanwhile, the (US-led) military interventions in Syria are a disaster. They've produced several blow back effects. In response, a recently announced Russian airbase, Avinograd, and a combat ship, Akademik Sergey Vavilov, were built. I expect the Russian's are not only going to demonstrate their air power, but also show the flag to the American's as a message that Russia is more than willing to\n"

And I take it for granted it is not possible. Nay, I am in great Hopes it will never come to be; and yet the Devil himself might as easily accomplish it, if he would think proper to bring about so unforeseen a Consequence. His Innocence is quite a Stranger to him, and is an imputed Felony to the Crime. The same Passion which has carried the Man on to so unworthy a Descent, may, at any other Time, have led him to any other Actions; for it can be no Crime, for a Man to advance himself to Pleasure, or his Genius to the Highest Grandeur. An Actor does not confess himself guilty when he has committed some Valour, and appears before his Audience in some Conduct that has wholly baffled the Ingenious Cabal. And all this while his Ingenuity keeps him in Honour, and receives Triumphs as of its own Contrivance; and he has an Excuse, too, for some Melancholy Declension, and a Degree of Discouragement in himself, which the By-standers cannot help admiring and attributing to Valour.\n\nWhy then is he not to be satisfied with these Assurances of his Innocence? Why must he put himself to so severe an Expense, as to steal up to the Heart of his Friend, to attempt his Aim? Truly because he is mortally afraid he has mistaken the Path, and knows not the way to return. 'Tis then reasonable he should double his Diligence, and rise up higher in the Compass, to inform himself of his Ignorance, than he would have done for any other Purpose, and I must suppose that too, in the extravagant Desire of taking off his Friend from the Torment of such an Inequity, by revealing the whole Scheme.\n\nBut what an Expensive Invention!

By Nature, Monimia's Honour has no exterior enclosure; there is none; there is no minimum boundary.\n\nAnd it is this Monimia's Honour which has become protected by the Interposition of Heaven, because it has overcome a magnitude of Evil, and protected against an Evil which was so strong, and which there is so little counteraction, that it was deemed absolute.\n\nOh! the power of Evil! One had said to the Old Regime, "I have killed myself." Another had said, "I have killed myself." And, say the highest minds, it is quite simple: men, at the moment of deciding to perish, are nearly always mistaken as to their reasons. They take no account of the ulterior consequences, of those consequences so cruel to their nearest of kin, of those consequences so terrible for their fathers, their fathers' fathers, their fathers' fathers' fathers, their ancestors.\n\nOh! the power of Evil! Indeed, the old churchmen attributed Evil to the Devil. The Tories of the eighteenth century attributed it to the Furies. To the author of Traité de l'homme (§ 23) the Devil created the World. The Catholics thought it came from the Devil. To the ultra-Catholics the Devil is omnipresent. Then they say that the Devil inhabits Man, in the heart. In short, the power of Evil has been perceived throughout the ages, in every clime, by every sect. To those who fear it, it has the fascination of a spectre, the fear of an incurable disease. Evil, as we know it today, exists only in men's imaginations, and in that men can destroy it there is, then, no power but that of the imagination.\n\nWhat men call Evil, is simply what men will; namely, what they desire, but which, by the constitution of things, they can never obtain. Man desires what he cannot have. Such is the reason why every satisfaction is in itself unsatisfactory.\n\nJust as the heat of the climate makes us desire the right of breathing and swimming in the air; just as we have an irrepressible desire to climb to the tops of mountains, and to risk our lives in the great waves; so also we desire life; that is, health, nourishment, joy.

"109"|"Triumphs over a Medical Rival"|"\nWhen patients and their medical doctors think their problems have no treatment, they usually turn to another field that once had no problem.\n\nThey often turn to alternative medicine.\n\nDoctors who have not used herbs and other forms of alternative medicine, in recent years, should be wary of some alternative treatments, such as Kava Kava.\n\nOn Feb. 24, 1993, the cover of one issue of the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reported a study that contradicted other research findings. It suggested that kava kava, a common drink in the Pacific Islands, was a successful treatment for people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nThe study “represents a significant advance over most prior research in this area,” says John P. Krystal, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. “The magnitude of change is noteworthy.”\n\nKrystal was the first to call attention to the validity of the kava kava finding. He published an article in JAMA in June, 1993, that “established the problem that was then pending correction.”\n\nAfter Krystal’s article appeared in JAMA, David Downs, a psychiatry professor at New York’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a colleague of Krystal’s, was asked by a major drug company to perform an independent review of all of the pertinent literature on kava kava.

"111"|"Acquires Employment in consequence of a lucky Miscarriage"|"\nThere is a widespread perception, within the technical field of human software engineering (HSE), that employment is unlikely to increase substantially in the near future because the area is not considered to be a mainstream area of study and consequently not many staff with strong academic records will be looking for employment. Whilst I recognise the validity of this perception in the general sense, I also strongly believe that this should not hinder one’s efforts to attain employment in HSE. In fact, I would say that the persisting uncertainty about whether or not to take a job in HSE can only make the situation more interesting than it would be otherwise.\n\nOne way of looking at this situation is to think that the field of HSE is nascent, and that the growing interest in the area reflects that fact. Accordingly, the field is likely to grow substantially over time, and by the time this happens the employment opportunities will increase. This approach is misleading, however, because it relies on the current circumstances having an impact on future developments. Perhaps there will not be a robust body of academic literature in HSE, but people with a passion for writing will fill the gaps. As HSE starts to gain more traction, the problems that currently make us look like something of a curiosity are likely to be corrected. The increasing interest in HSE should result in a rapidly increasing body of material that we can all draw upon, and an increasing number of jobs to be filled.\n\nThis is not to say that I believe HSE will eventually be an established area of study, nor is it to say that every job that becomes available will have to be filled by an HSE graduate. Jobs will exist for people with exceptional communication skills, incredible programming skills and writing ability. The issue is that the relatively small number of jobs that exist in the area will be occupied by academic researchers who do not have much experience with day-to-day programming in a corporate environment, or who have experience but would like a change.\n\nIn that context, the possession of an academic record from an HSE programme is no longer a disadvantage. Rather, it is actually a very attractive factor. In fact, a whole career in HSE can be built upon academic papers, and so the absence of any may prove to be a significant handicap for those whose initial attempts to get into the industry fail. If the desire to learn about HSE is the motivation that keeps one interested in the field, then this means that the relative scarcity of jobs in the area is unlikely to matter much\n"

"113"|"He meditates Schemes of Importance"|"\nAt first I had mixed feelings about this story. I love the structure of this story - it's like a disjointed eighties action film, but it doesn't jump around, and it doesn't leave you waiting. There are a lot of plot elements, but they're given time to develop and I felt that I understood why they were happening and what they meant. While the story has a very "platonic" feel, we're not always having "Tea and Chat" with Matt and Eric, and occasionally we see Matt's POV.\n\nI think that the attention to detail is quite admirable and in my own short stories, I'd like to be able to do that, but that's a huge amount of effort. In this story, they both have phones, because we see the beginning and the end of it, but the middle is mostly Matt's, and I was glad that the boys didn't buy phones in between to save on plot points. I'm also glad that I haven't read any of the books that those characters in the story are reading, because I wouldn't want to be distracted by any literary comparisons that someone makes in a story. It was a nice little trip and I liked how it ended, but for those looking for something a bit more involved, or that can be seen in much greater detail, maybe this isn't the story for you.\n\nThis was a beautiful story! It's definitely one of my favourites that's come out this year, and I definitely recommend it.\n\nI love the way that this book begins with Matt having to scold Eric, telling him to pull himself together, and then all the cards fall in place. And even though this book is super busy, and very dramatic, it does have an ebb and flow, that really should be noted, as there is a lot to go over. The characters are incredibly strong and relatable, and they come together in an incredible way. And at times, it's simply incredible, and at other times, it's heartbreaking. This is one of those books where it's a very emotional ride and I was thoroughly moved while reading. It's one of those stories that can move you to tears at just the slightest touch, and it's quite powerful.\n\nMatthew, Matt, is only described as a “twenty-five year old graduate”, and it’s not really noted when the story begins.

He humbled himself for the sins of all men; he was rejected, condemned, and sent to the cross; and that, which was the cause of his life and death, was converted to life by the act of his glorification. He ascended into heaven, and there he sits at the right hand of God the Father, in order to give us this grace, that we may enjoy it. For this grace was a free gift to all men, but he chose us, and we were created to receive it.\n\nHereby was fulfilled that saying, that whoever believeth on him shall not be condemned; which was uttered by Peter, who was not a saint, yet for that he believed he was justified; and here it was fulfilled that saying, "If you believe not the words which I speak unto you, you shall be condemned in a more sure way, because I speak to you the words of God."\n\nAstonishingly, a stolid, brutish, unprincipled and ignorant man shall become a perfect and perfect man. He shall grow in love and in holiness: he shall be like God. And, without doubt, the grace which God gave unto his Son was most nobly and supremely performed, and has been most honourably and truly accomplished.\n\nThe Holy Scripture teacheth you also, that the same grace which God hath given to his beloved Son, he gave unto all men. Therefore, why are you so much astonished if you read that he accepted Peter also? Why do you marvel if you read that he accepted many other men also, such as Stephen, and such as all the prophets, and your blessed ancestors also?\n\nHowever, by your tender conscience, you cannot believe that God hath given this great and singular grace to all men without any limitation. For your consciences assure you, that it is most displeasing in you to believe that the grace of this mercy is granted to us all without any limitation or restriction; it is displeasing in you that it is unbeguiled and unwise to believe this\n"

This approach I think, is a unique one in the best possible sense. It is ‘atypical’, because there is a similar approach to studying classics, called philology, whose practitioners and thinkers have actually come up with an ‘Aristotelian logic’.

One of the fundamental tenets of the show is that you can’t rely on empirical knowledge. In order to be able to utilize anything you have to analyse the various levels of how it was made; how the story is told and how it’s played out in the final form.

His Favourite Action was to open his Book with the Argument of one of his Thoughts, and then to walk through the whole Booke, and with all his Spirit, pour it out again on his Reader. ’Tis but Reason he should take this liberty, since it is evident, that the Book of Nature it self is written by him, and that all the Readers do not look for the same Speeches. Mr. Locke, who pretends to that honour, has not bethought him to do the same, nor would it have become him, to offer to give the World a single Expression of the True Opinion, or the Effects of his Reason upon his Subject. The grand Error of the Old Philosophers, which he justly stigmatizes, was, that ’tis wholly impossible for a Man to know with certainty what is done by God, or in God, either in a very Person, or any way whatever, as one Body’s Motion belongs to several Persons; if he does not know, that a great enough power, without which Motion could not be, or be made at all, could do it, it could not be the same great power, if there were no room, and it is the same in other cases. But the Heathens thought it very strange, when the Gods made Earthquakes in the Sea, which is the same thing to say, that made the Earthquake. Mr. Locke with great candour proposes, That as they believed at first, Earthquakes, Comets, Comets’ Bodies, &c. to be natural Phenomena, till after such a Time, when there was a Consensus of Opinions to the contrary, these Opinions of the Ancients are not to be regarded. Not that he thinks that the World is like Men, who, tho’ they have a better Power, yet cannot conceive in their Minds the true State of the subject; for of that they may be certain enough, tho they cannot be of what is done by Nature, tho’ it is known\n"

It was so good I had the leftover cheese spread over the top of the muffins.\n\nThe next day I had one and I was really hungry. I could not get this silly craving out of my head. So I made myself a nice omelet, as I often do, but there was something missing. The thing I needed in the omelet was a cheesy and savory filling. I realized that it would make a great and yummy breakfast or brunch food, so I started thinking of ideas. I was supposed to go out for a bike ride this morning but I could not get out of bed and my little baking didn't help that much. Finally I got the energy to go downstairs and saw the ingredients that I had for breakfast and said to myself "we can make a little breakfast quiche or a quiche tart!".\n\nI started looking in my cookbook for quiche recipes and I found several very good ones. I ended up with this one:Quiche tart with soft cheese, asparagus, ham and prosciutto. This has a total of nine eggs in it. First of all it was a lot of eggs, but I do not like eggs that much so I was really happy that I could reduce them. Secondly it is really versatile and can be made with or without pasta. Finally it is not a complicated recipe and has a lot of delicious ingredients that are easy to find. I also liked how it had an almost raw flavor, which is not as raw as a quiche with potatoes, but not as sharp as a raw pie. This will be perfect to celebrate all my love for the pasta dish and will also be a great breakfast for a week or more. The only thing is that I used asparagus instead of mushrooms.\n\nAs you can see in the picture above, I made the quiche for a nice and hot breakfast, but it was also really good cold, with or without salad. The combination of ham, ham and prosciutto, cheese and ham is really delicious.\n\nAll you need for this recipe is:\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n\na small bag of asparagus\n\n1 tsp dried thyme\n\na bit of parmesean\n\na bit of proscuitto\n\nan onion\n\nolive oil\n"

Answer: Spray and pray\n\nMay 6, 2018\n\nIf you're tired of fruit flies that descend on your green peas and melons, you can get rid of them with a household spray or paste-type stuff. Use it carefully, however, and be aware that it may have harmful side effects.\n\nA fruit fly, or "rotten fruit" fly, is a kind of fly that is attracted to rotting or fermenting fruit. Fruit flies in great numbers or in places where there's been some kind of food spoilage can wreak havoc in your kitchen and in your family's food supplies.\n\nMost fruits, such as apples, oranges, pears and plums, contain an enzyme that causes them to ferment or rot, although not all fruit species are affected. Berries are especially prone to rot and therefore are the most frequent food for fruit flies.\n\nMost fruit flies in the U.S. are from the Asian Sub-species (Dacus dorsalis) but some imported strains have been involved in food contamination and disease.\n\nLike most flies, fruit flies have a liking for fermenting food. Their favorite foods are fruits and the pomace that accumulates at the bottom of the barrels or the grain of wine and beer fermentations. The pomace and the grain are a nutrient-rich diet that is easier for the insects to get into than the liquid.\n\nThey lay their eggs in fresh fruit and continue to lay until they hatch. The larvae are quite large and have a more or less branched yellowish-orange shell. They eat and feed for 10 days and then spin a cocoon, hanging on upside down on the food with their heads sticking out. Once they've emerged from the cocoon, they look like lumps of human hair. A larva feeds for a short time and then spins a second cocoon, this time on its side. When it comes out of the second cocoon, it's ready to become a pupa. It stays in this stage for 10 days. After that, it goes on to maturity and it's wings are well developed. Its life is normally about 30 days. After it's over, the larvae die off.\n\nUnlike the adults, the larvae don't eat much, as their main activity is the building of the cocoons and the egg-laying.\n\nEven though the life cycle of a fruit fly can be short, the number of adults in a given area can increase and then reach\n"

The simple fact is most people have no idea what they are doing, they would rather just look at the thing and go “it’s a tie”, I know you have seen the people on television that have such big extravagant fashion show clothes on and you simply say, “they look so elegant.” You have probably even watched TV shows like Downton Abbey. They have such fine clothes, that when you see them on a man it just looks elegant. However, it is the fashion-y tie they are wearing that really makes that impression, not the way they wear the tie. I will say, I am a “fashion-y tie” guy. I know what I am looking for, and I have been trying to correct the mistakes that people make when they wear their ties.\n\nI know what a bow tie should look like. In fact, I like to tie them the right way. When I look at the way people tie their ties I can see all the mistakes they are making. So I will outline a few things that I know most people do wrong. Now, before I get into that, let me start off by saying, how to tie a bow tie is not a simple task, it takes a while to get there. I am not a big fan of short cuts. If you can get to a position that is easy and looks good, I say go for it, but if you are going to be a big old hot mess, it will take a lot longer to do it correctly.\n"

"140"|"How to love?"|"How to love? Is it a performance?\n\nWe are creatures of practice. We are, it turns out, evolved for the purpose of having sex with people, and those around us, and our own selves. The act of love is quite often practiced, practiced like a sport, because it can be learnt, and one can improve on one’s performance in it. But is it a performance? If so, is that how one should love?\n\nLet’s begin by noticing some sex things we don’t always think about. Sex is literally and figuratively, our “play”, something we practice. It is not the thing itself. It is the interaction with it that we learn. So it is a performance. This is most obvious in sex with children, where the object is children and the instruction is different. It’s a performance there, but one in which the performers have already perfected their skills.\n\nA kid needs to be licked, sucked, pulled, and moved. He needs to get so aroused that he can’t control his own body, that he goes right up to the edge, beyond which he sometimes stops. So the performance in this case, requires not just physical skills, but emotional and mental skills. One has to have prepared the baby for, and learned how to satisfy, the baby. A sure-fire way to get a child very quickly aroused and ready for play is to start a conversation on the subject of babies, their instincts and what babies need.\n\nSex is the performance of love\n\nThere are many other, non-sexual examples of the act of love and sex being essentially performances, like playing with children. A good parent knows that a child needs to be entertained, “played” with. A good mother will play with the child even before it can walk, before the child’s motor skills are strong enough to interact with you. Like a child, the baby needs to learn what to do in order to interact with its mother’s fingers, or hand, or breasts. Mothers who refuse to play are no good mothers. They teach a child, who then practices the act of sex, who learns his sex from the experience of playing with the mom he/she grew up with. It’s as simple as that.\n\nWith toddlers, you have to know what buttons to push. Most little kids go in phases, and learn in phases, too. When a baby learns something it doesn�\n"
"141"|"How to hard boil eggs?"|"How to hard boil eggs? A simple guide to cracking them\n\nA Guide to How to hard boil eggs:\n\nThe most important thing to do before hard boiling eggs, is to get the eggs out of the fridge well in advance. It will help to slightly warm them up, but only just, otherwise the eggs will crack. Once the eggs are out of the fridge, and the water has been boiling (about 7 minutes) you can add the vinegar and salt to taste, and leave them to boil for the time you want. They will then hard boil and should be eaten straight away, if you want to store them in an airtight container, give them another hour.\n\nThe reason I say the eggs must be out of the fridge is so that the salt and vinegar don’t come in contact with the cold metal, which would stop them from boiling, and may even make them explode.\n\nFirstly I think it’s best to boil eggs like you would any other shellfish. So get a large bowl of hot water, place the eggs in the water, add the vinegar and salt to taste, place the bowl over a pan of boiling water and leave the eggs to boil for the time you want, i.e. 3 minutes. They will pop out into the bowl and turn a lighter shade of yellow in the process.\n\nAfter you’ve boiled the eggs you can remove them from the pan, and start peeling. I have heard that the trick is to run the tip of a fork along the inside of the eggs, but this is a bit more work. I know someone who has a basket in the oven on the shelf above the actual eggs, then when the basket is opened, the eggs are released, and the basket is immediately removed and the eggs are ready.\n\nBy the way, the advice to clean eggs with boiling water doesn’t work with yolks, so you have to use cold water.\n\nYou can use the egg shells to crack the eggs, and the egg yolks to make mayonnaise. This was my first attempt.\n\nAnd then I tried this other way, which is easier, although I think a fork is much more attractive.\n\nI find these yolks make really good mayonnaise, and I recommend that you have them around, because they look so pretty!\n\nHow to crack eggs\n\nI found out that this method of cracking eggs is much quicker, it takes about 3 seconds, and is much easier\n"

"149"|"How to make pizza?"|"\nThats a question to which everyone has his own answer. Every recipe varies depending on how you like it. Different cultures and regions have their own way of cooking pizza.\n\nBasically there are two main types of pizza: Margherita and Lasagna. The Lasagna pizza is very common in the southern part of the United States while the Margherita is the pizza I prefer. And I also like it better than most American pizza.\n\nMaking a great pizza requires several important things:\n\n1) The Pizza Base\n\nThis is the most important part because the rest of the pizza is just toppings. Usually pizza bases have good texture and crunchy (or soft) characteristic.\n\nYou can use your favorite dough recipe to make the dough. Personally, I use my old bread dough recipe that uses yeast. It doesn’t taste the same like my grandma made the dough, but it’s good to me.\n\nA pizza dough recipe usually makes a light airy dough with a good stretchy feel. All you need is flour, salt, sugar and a little yeast. I used to add an egg, but no more because it makes the dough too soft. If you want to add an egg, then consider a small amount.\n\nDepending on the kind of flour you use, the yeast amount may be different. I always use yeast amount around 4-8 g. However, if you want a thick crust, use a higher amount of yeast (around 8-16 g).\n\nThe time the dough is resting should be adjusted according to the flour used. Since flour plays a very important role on the final outcome of the pizza, it’s very important that you do not omit the resting time.\n\nJust as yeast, yeast amount may differ from pizza recipe to another. I suggest around 2g per pizzas is the proper amount.\n\n2) The Baking\n\nTo make a pizza the same way you like it, you have to bake it the same way. You have to choose a right oven temperature and time. It is very important to not over bake the pizza because you want the dough to cook first, so, with all the sauce and toppings, your pizza won’t become dry and crispy on the surface.\n\nIf you don’t know how to choose the right temperature and time, you can always try something. If your oven is not so nice (and mine isn’t), I suggest using\n"

I would love to hear your suggestions, please share them in the comments below.\n\nI am sure you know what it means to meditate, but maybe you don’t know how to start doing it right away. In this post I will go over several different meditation techniques and outline what to think about in order to get the most out of them.\n\nWhat is meditation?\n\nMeditation has been called one of the most important and effective practices of self-development. Meditation is the systematic training of the mind to access the stillness within. Meditating is focusing one’s attention for a period of time on some activity, such as breathing, going through the thoughts of one’s daily life, or taking a walk. The goal is to let go of the thoughts, the desires, and the mental activities which come one after another.\n\nMeditation requires the use of concentration in order to be effective. There are various methods, and all can be very effective depending on the person’s ability to concentrate.\n\nIt is important to practice meditation several times a week. By establishing it as a daily habit, it will help you get more out of it in the long run. I will outline three ways of doing so: starting a practice, doing it when distracted, and doing it while traveling.\n\nTips on starting your practice\n\nSince it takes some time to establish and perfect your meditation practice, it’s a good idea to start in small steps. Start with something very simple, like sitting down and meditating for just one minute a day. Once you become comfortable with one-minute meditations, you will be able to work up to doing them for longer periods of time.\n\nIf you struggle with boredom, here are two of my favorite relaxation exercises to try out.\n\n20 seconds of breathing exercises: Breathing deeply for 20 seconds will definitely relax the whole body and will send a signal to the body to get ready for the relaxation.

There's two sides missing.\n\nI can rotate it both ways, but I can't get the missing side to line up with one of the sides. If I set the sides together, it's still the wrong way. If I set the corners together, it's still the wrong way. I can't turn it left or right or up or down. If I cut off a corner, and put it back, it's still the wrong way.\n\nAny suggestions? I don't want the cube to get un-solvable, I just want a way to play with it.\n\nNote: When I set the sides together, it looks like it would be solved, because all the cubes seem to line up, but then I turn it back the wrong way, and the wrong side doesn't line up, and I know that there's something wrong because the two sides have changed positions, but they still don't line up.\n\nFor your cube you have a constant 'problem cube' and a variable or/and altering 'normal cube' in which you work on. You start with the normal cube, then you use the problem cube to help you solve the normal cube.\n\nTo get the problem cube into the correct orientation, find one corner, and move it around in all the other possible orientations until it fits with the other 3 corners.\n\nHere is a solvabar analogy. We have a bar, in which we can stack on 1, 2 or 3. To build a cube, we put up a problem cube, that is itself two cubes stacked one on top of the other, in any possible way (orientation).\n\nIf you rotate the problem cube in such a way that it's orientation is correct with your bar cube, then you're good to go.\n\nOriginally posted by StaffI'd like to know why you are wondering how to solve a rubix cube.\n\nIf you get no ideas, maybe you should be reading a book on\n"

How can you call something a spoiler if you still haven’t watched it? I asked that question several times to different people over the course of this morning’s meeting, and everybody kept turning their attention back to me.\n\n“Well, you have to ask me that when you’ve read the book,” Roger offered.\n\n“I have not read the book,” said Kestrel. “No.”\n\nThis then is the problem with book-spoiler controversies, at least in the UK. The process of self-censorship that they call books and then turn around and pass off as necessary public discourse — for the sake of which, presumably, the internet’s vast and largely unregulated bandwidth is provided — is what’s most dangerous here. Not to the information distribution, but to what information we choose to distribute.\n\nSo how, exactly, do you stop the information from leaking out?\n\n“Well,” said Ben Walters, a fellow I talked to before the meeting, “you’re talking about a juicy interview, right?

There are, of course, perfectly good reasons to have journalists’ integrity vetted. Journalistic integrity is one, and the fact that there’s no reason for a publishing company to have that vetted, however, is another.\n\nThe company is not an academic institution, it’s a public commercial concern.

Or, I am a huge fan of the arugula and asparagus as a simple salad.\n\nYea asparagus is kinda over-rated! There’s a reason you don’t see asparagus with quinoa or pasta. It’s difficult to find an ingredient that’s a bit milder. Plus, its a little bitter. If you make quinoa risotto you’ll get a nice mushroom risotto texture (sweet, buttery, like chestnuts). For pasta, I like spicy roasted pasta salad. Simple is the key here. I highly suggest you try toasting nuts like almonds or walnuts. You can chop them, but it’s best to toast them in a 350 degree oven until the light golden color.\n\nThe asparagus will not only take longer to cook than other vegetables, but the stem ends are woody and the tips tend to get a little bitter, as in the case of organic asparagus. There are two good ways to fix this. The first is to buy regular asparagus, not organic, and cut it into short pieces with a sharp knife. This will make the asparagus less bitter. The second is to steam it. To do so, heat a large pot of water until it comes to a full rolling boil. Add about a quarter cup of salt. Asparagus is a very good source of minerals and too much salt will make them bitter, so avoid it. Once the water has a full boil, you will have about 3 to 4 minutes before you want to add the asparagus. It’s important to keep in mind that asparagus is a diuretic and will dry you out. So, don’t over do it. Once the asparagus is at that boil, count out about four pieces. I normally do it by the number four. You want a cup for every four pieces and it will be much more attractive to everyone. Then, after about two minutes, add the asparagus. Let it steam for another two minutes before you drain and rinse the asparagus. When it’s cooked, serve it in a big bowl with extra virgin olive oil, lemon, black pepper, and maybe some grilled or sauteed mushrooms.\n\nOh, and\n"

"159"|"How to cook quinoa?"|"\nBy Pearl ClementiNovember 07, 2018\n\nHow to cook quinoa? If you’ve been around the internet for any amount of time, you’ve probably seen someone pose a question like this. The quinoa-loving brigade often seem bewildered about how to cook the tasty grain in a way that gives you the most flavor. Does it have to cook in three stages? How long does it cook for? Is it supposed to get mushy? Well, I’ve got the answers to those questions (plus some more) below.\n\nBut first, some quick facts and tips about quinoa.\n\nCooking time: 5-10 minutes.\n\nPossible uses: The protein-rich, gluten-free grain is a very versatile ingredient that can be cooked in a variety of ways, and it’s one of the most nutritious. It’s an excellent alternative to rice and can be used as a whole grain, a side dish, or a base for some delicious desserts.\n\nWhy do so many people call it quinoa? Quinoa is actually a relative of wild and domesticated peas and are native to the Andean regions of South America. When the Spanish colonized the area in the 16th century, they adopted the name quinoa, and the grain spread to Europe and the U.S.\n\nQuinoa is most often cooked in liquid, like water or broth, and then chilled to preserve its beautiful colors and flavors. Soaking the quinoa in plenty of water prior to cooking will help absorb the nutrients in the grain, and also makes it much easier to digest. And if you’ve read my post on how to cook rice, you’ll know that I usually start with a water-to-quinoa ratio of about two-to-one. Some people find a ratio of one-to-one works better. For a big batch, I’ve also found it helpful to use a small rice pot.\n\nCooking quinoa: There are actually a few different methods for cooking the grain, and I tend to use the ones that work best with my stove.\n\nTraditional method: Bring the amount of water that you’d like to cook with and bring it to a boil. Stir in the quinoa and reduce the heat to low. Once the liquid starts to bubble, cover with a lid and cook for 10-15 minutes. (This method works best on a stove top\n"

Be Positive\n\nThis is something that everybody wants to achieve but how many of us actually do that?

Creating a anime character tutorial and analysis of Namco-Bandai's models\n\nWhen I was younger, my most vivid memories of school were usually either English classes or figure drawing.\n\nFigure drawing was always something that stood out and was super fun to do, but at the same time was rather silly. There is no way of drawing well without an obvious set of standards and rules, and when I learned about them, I can see how absurd it was that they did not even apply to children. That said, however, it became clear to me just how confusing the classroom situation was. In addition to learning very specific things and skills, for example: drawing anatomy, colour, lighting, perspective, scale, proportion, and composition, we also learned rules that very few of us respected, such as: you could not be ugly if you are drawing a face.\n\nIt didn’t take long for my insides to become heavily charred from an education that set itself on fire, but fortunately, the flames were put out by drawing manga and anime.\n\nSince that time, the complexity of the types of drawings I had seen have grown exponentially and have varied between a thousand and infinity, and it has become impossible for me to not study at least the basics.\n\nWhile it seems quite unfair for the sole reason that it is never possible to be proficient in every type of art or artist, I take a pretty positive look on this because, obviously, not everyone is into anime, manga, or illustration.\n\nNow, when I think about what I learned about cartooning and what I still have to learn, it appears that the lines separating mediums and mediumist are very blurry.\n\nIn fact, most of the drawings I see in magazines and book covers are actually very similar to what I would want to draw, and the reason for that is because they don’t follow a set of standards. It is very likely that most of these illustrations have not even gone through an art school, or have not followed a set of steps to create something different.\n\nThat does not mean that you cannot produce a quality result though.\n\nWhile I won’t give you a straightforward “follow these steps to draw a perfect portrait” lesson, I will give you some tips that, when followed in the correct order, should make your drawings better.\n\nRemember, these do not make anime drawing harder, they only make it easier.

And if it isn’t obvious, does that mean I’m just waiting for you to hit on me or—conversely—that you just happen to be quite charming? You don’t have to tell me why you want advice; I understand, as you’ve shared with me, your experience of seeing “brilliant men” who don’t go anywhere with you or at least don’t date you and “awkward men” who don’t get past hello and keep wanting to date you. You’re not the only one to feel this way. In your situation, you’ve been dating a man for nearly a year and you two are at a romantic restaurant with wine and nice food and an intimate setting. You feel a connection, and you seem to be able to have a lovely and fun time. The question arises whether he might like you a little more than just that. One of my favorite pieces of advice to women I’ve encountered over the years came from a woman who writes and does a lot of community service at a homeless shelter in her town. She said, “It’s not what he does with me, it’s how he does it.” Since I live in the south, this is often a cultural clash. Here, you could try sharing an experience from your past. If he asks about it, he might be interested enough to want to hear about the experience himself. My friend who knows your situation has mentioned that this can be a signal to her that a guy is interested. And while this man might not be perfect, your situation is not one that often comes along, so you might be doing well to give him the benefit of the doubt. You might also want to read up on it yourself on his favorite topics\n"

(the flavor is usually a choice between strawberry and vanilla or blueberry and raspberry or mango and peach). Let the flavors drain for 5-10 minutes after pouring the mixture over the baking dish or into the cups. (It’s not necessary to put the jello in the dish. If you want to put it in the dish, you can pour the jello directly over the bowl/plate, but I would advise against it. It’s very hard to even get a jello shot out of a baking dish. The jello will be difficult to take out). Put the baking dish on a wire rack for at least 2 hours, overnight or till the jello is completely set.\n\nStir and serve\n\nYield: 8 to 10 jello shots per package of jello\n\nIngredients:\n\n4 cups of liquid (I used 2 cups of boiling water and 2 cups of the jello mix). Use only hot water or jello mixture if using 2 cups of liquid. (The 2 cups of liquid is equal to 1 cup of Jello. The liquid can be hot or cold. It’s necessary to have at least two cups of liquid or the jello will not set up properly).\n\n1 cup of finely chopped fresh fruit (apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, etc. Don’t chop too finely. The jello is very gelatinous. The fruit can be fresh or frozen)\n\n12 strawberries, hulled and sliced\n\n1/2 cup to 1 cup of chopped nuts or seeds (almonds, peanuts, pecans, hazelnuts, etc.)\n\nYou can stir the chopped fruit in a food processor or blender and then use that mixture to create the garnish.

"171"|"How to poach an egg?"|"How to poach an egg? Whether you’re cooking or serving eggs in a restaurant, you may have found yourself asking this question. Perhaps you’re asking it yourself, or maybe you’re asking it in front of your guests. The answer is easy and the method is fast and fool-proof. Here’s the simple trick.\n\n10 Ways to Poach An Egg\n\nPlease note: This article will be more useful to cooks who have never poached an egg before. If you have poached eggs down pat, feel free to share the knowledge in the comments below. Otherwise, read on to discover all the tricks and techniques for getting perfectly poached eggs every time.\n\n1. Bring water to a boil\n\nPoach eggs at a boil\n\nThe first step is to boil a pot of water. The water should be about 180°F to 220°F (82.2°C to 104°C) (source). Bring water to a full boil in a medium pot, preferably a non-reactive pot like cast iron or enameled cast iron. This is to prevent a non-stick coating from sticking to the egg when it’s finished cooking.\n\nWhile the water is heating, you’ll want to turn on your stove’s timer. Make sure the timer goes to the 1-minute mark. A good rule of thumb for a 1-minute timer is to make sure the water boils for 1 minute before you take out the eggs. The reason for this is so you know you’re cooked eggs through and all of the whites have cooked sufficiently for serving.\n\nDon’t worry if you’re poaching a large number of eggs at the same time. This is how the restaurant does it. You’re going to be cooking the eggs a bit quicker than they’re done for an entire dinner service (1:10:00 or so). It’s your risk to take.\n\n2. Add the eggs to the boiling water\n\nArrange a steaming basket under the faucet to hold the eggs while poaching\n\nThe easiest way to get started poaching an egg is to place them in a steaming basket or sieve. Steaming baskets are metal or plastic wire frames with holes so water can pass through them and not touch the eggs. Sieves are similar except they’re usually clear plastic. Steaming baskets are better than sieves for this, however, sieves can\n"
"172"|"How to make ice cream?"|"\nYou’ve probably heard that ice cream is a dessert that you make from scratch. But have you ever stopped to think about what exactly that means?\n\nThe most common answer that I have gotten from home cooks is that making ice cream from scratch means that you are going to be chopping up ingredients like eggs, milk and sugar until they just become one big creamy mass. I get it, that sounds nice in theory, but when you get down to it it doesn’t always seem like a realistic goal.\n\nSo what really does it mean to make ice cream from scratch?\n\nI’ve been working on my own ice cream recipe for several months, and I’m confident that the answer to that question is no different than it is for the recipe that I’ve been developing. But for the sake of having something to share with you all, I figured I would give it a try.\n\nThe first thing to do is start by buying a few things:\n\n1 quart can of condensed milk 2 cups of sugar 1 cup of unsalted butter 6 eggs\n\nAll of those ingredients can be purchased at any grocery store, and if you don’t have any at home they will probably be the cheapest items that you can get your hands on.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is make sure that you can cook that quart of condensed milk. Condensed milk, like half and half, will thicken when heated up so if your stove doesn’t allow you to do that you’ll need to purchase a can of evaporated milk and put that in to thicken the milk.\n\nThe sugar should go in first, followed by the eggs, and finally the condensed milk.\n\nNext you’ll want to blend everything together until you have a smooth mixture that holds its shape. Then you’ll strain the mixture through a sieve and return it to your pot and reheat.\n\nFinally, you’ll want to let the ice cream mixture cool until it is room temperature.\n\nOnce it is cooled you’ll transfer it to an ice cream maker and churn it as per your ice cream maker’s instructions.\n\nThat’s it! And the most important step, is not to worry about whether it will taste right, or be successful.\n\nThe best ice cream is the one that is the most delicious that you want to eat, and the one that makes you\n"

Shouldn't you eat the squash itself?\n\nMy family usually eats spaghetti squash, it's a very versatile vegetable. We boil and puree it and use it in different ways. It is also delicious on it's own as well. I made a stuffed one recently that was delicious! Here are a few ideas of what you can do with it:\n\n1. Slice into half moons and bake until tender, about 45 minutes to an hour. It can be served with Parmesan cheese, grated cheddar, or feta, salt and pepper. Add a small amount of olive oil and garlic to taste.\n\n2. You can also use this vegetable to make a pasta sauce, or as a stuffing or topping.\n\n3. I also shred it with a cheese grater and serve it like that. It's also very delicious served with a dollop of cream cheese and tossed with spinach, chicken or beef.\n\n4.

"174"|"How to make fried rice?"|"How to make fried rice? Simply put, this is rice, but not that rice. Most rice has to be cooked until slightly stiff. If you stir-fry it it’s gonna be bad, if you fry it, it’s going to be perfect. Rice is very adaptable and makes for one of the easiest dishes in my opinion. It can also take you way too long to make. Plus it doesn’t look particularly impressive.\n\nSo, what’s that? I like my rice kinda dark and somewhat sweet. I love Chinese cuisine, but I am not fond of rice by itself. I eat it everyday. I use it as a filler in dishes. So what should I do?\n\nWhy not just use meat? Because I really don’t want to eat chicken, fish, beef, pork or beef, squid, seafood, other kinds of meat with this dish. The flavor is intense and it would make it feel like a failure to use this ingredient.\n\nNow what? Let’s get a clue. I’m actually making this dish when we have this Vietnamese egg noodle soup that my husband loves. I think it’s part of my cooking goal to always try to integrate Vietnamese flavors and products into my everyday life. So, obviously, this fried rice will be cooked with a thick broth of Vietnamese egg noodle soup. It will have Vietnamese-ish flavor and because it’s cooked with the egg noodles I have no need to add additional flavor to it. The whole dish is then simmered for a bit so that it becomes chewy and tastes more like soup instead of fried rice. The rest of the ingredients are just convenient.\n\nThis recipe is basically an ode to Vietnamese food and is a great “stand alone” dish. I think I have yet to incorporate it into my everyday life, so it probably needs some work.\n\nGo read my recent article about Vietamese Egg Noodle Soup. Then, look at the bolded bit and then read on.\n\nGreen onion and sesame oil are essential ingredients to this dish. As a bonus, it tastes like a cross between soy sauce and sesame oil. Go ahead and add either or both. Green onion, though, is definitely the way to go, but soy sauce also works.\n\nStir-frying has become such a convenient way of cooking nowadays. I cook my rice like this so that it’s not sticky and flavorful\n"

As soon as you find something that works, be sure to follow through with the regimen, because once you find the right acne treatment, it is very important to stick to the plan and not cheat.\n\nI’m sure you’ve heard about pimples in your life, but you might have never given them too much thought.

The solution for the problem isn’t to wait for something to magically appear or disappear, but to understand what causes them in the first place and then find acne treatment that will help you avoid them.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\n\nSee a doctor if the pimples are bothersome or you’re concerned about how severe they might be. Although, because acne can run in families, you might be already experiencing pimples. If they are very bad or if you just feel uncomfortable not knowing what is causing your acne, make an appointment with a dermatologist.\n\nWhat are the causes of pimples?\n\nEveryone’s skin is different, so the causes of pimples can vary depending on the person. However, there are some general causes of pimples. Here are some of the most common causes of pimples:\n\nWhen you’re sleeping.

So make sure you’re getting plenty of sleep each night and in the morning, your skin will be able to rest and repair itself.\n\nStress. Aside from not sleeping enough, too much stress can make it more difficult to sleep. That could mean your skin is not absorbing enough Vitamin D and is instead, being worked much harder than usual. This can make pimples even worse.\n\nBreaks in your skin barrier. Many skin care products contain harsh chemicals, which can dry out your skin and cause it to crack and begin flaking.

Stretch marks may be the one of the skin trouble for women to get rid of it, especially women of puberty, young ages and pregnant.\n\nTight and lumpy skin or stretch marks are usually caused by overexertion, like frequent exercise or pregnancy. The cutaneous condition is normal, but its severity and appearance can cause a great deal of distress. Some stretch marks are aesthetically pleasing, but there are others that can look very ugly. For many people, stretch marks is a simple skin issue that will heal spontaneously in a few months. However, in certain situations, stretch marks can be a serious and permanent problem.\n\nStretch marks occur when the skin and subcutaneous layers are stretched and pulled, causing the collagen to break down. Even when the skin heals completely, stretch marks often remain as small tan or white spots or marks on the skin.\n\nTight Skin\n\nTight skin is usually experienced as itching, pain, lumpiness, and dryness. After birth, babies and even small children often suffer from tight skin. Tight skin can be caused by changing hormone levels in puberty or excessive weight gain or loss. It may also result from an illness, such as hepatitis or diabetes.\n\nThe condition is treated using massage, topical creams, and sometimes painful injections. Tight skin in early pregnancy usually goes away on its own after the fourth month of pregnancy. In severe cases, doctors may recommend epidermal grafting surgery, where a small area of the skin is taken from the breast, belly, thigh, or shoulder and used to cover the area where the skin is too tight. If the cause of the tight skin cannot be determined, it may be treated with noninvasive approaches, such as laser therapy.\n\nStretch Marks\n\nStretch marks are characterized by darkened areas of skin caused by wrinkles. They are also called striae, blotches, or striae rubra.\n\nThe primary causes of stretch marks are pregnancy, growth, tight skin, elasticity of the skin, hormonal changes during puberty, and extensive exercise. Stretch marks are not a permanent condition, however, and are usually completely gone when the affected areas are covered or allowed to heal. If you have stretch marks, you can expect to see lightened skin in the affected areas. If you stretch marks are caused by a problem with the skin’s elasticity, the problem usually goes away after the condition improves.

"180"|"How to lower blood pressure?"|"\nWhat Causes Hypertension?\n\nThe main reason for elevated blood pressure or hypertension is a diet high in salt (sodium chloride), lack of exercise, dehydration and stress. It is also possible for a person to have high blood pressure with no reason (sometimes called “essential hypertension”). Other factors such as obesity and being female can affect blood pressure as well. As a matter of fact, when hypertension runs in a family, it’s more likely to be caused by genetics than lifestyle.\n\nChronically high blood pressure (HBP) damages the walls of your arteries. Over time, the arteries may be weakened, reducing their ability to let blood flow. If that happens, your heart and lungs need to work harder and use more oxygen to bring oxygenated blood to the tissues. As a result, you may feel tired or even short of breath.\n\nAn A-rated blood pressure is not just about “high blood pressure”; it is about proper blood pressure. In fact, if your blood pressure is high, you could also be experiencing some of the following:\n\nWhat are some of the symptoms of Hypertension?\n\nHigh Blood Pressure\n\nA condition that occurs when a person has blood pressure that is higher than normal, even if not dangerously high.

I want to use formula: body weight/(height in meter^2)\n\nA:\n\nYou need to do the following things to calculate BMI:\n\nConvert the weight into kgs and store in an integer variable.\nUse Math.sqrt to get the square of the height, store it in another integer variable.\nConvert the squared height into meters and sqrt() it to store it in another integer variable.\nNow multiply the two variables and finally divide the result by 25 to get your BMI.\n\nNote: It is necessary to use Math.sqrt() since you are dealing with integers.\nBelow is the full code:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\ndouble bmi = calculateBMI(24, 6, 2);\nSystem.out.println("BMI: " + bmi);\ndouble weight = 25;\ndouble height = 6;\ndouble m = Math.pow(Math.sqrt(height), 2);\ndouble w = weight * m;\ndouble d = (w/bmi);\nSystem.out.println(d);\n}\n\npublic static double calculateBMI(int weight, int height, double m) {\ndouble bmi = ((weight * weight) / (height * height));\nif(bmi >= 25) {\nreturn bmi;\n} else {\nreturn 25;\n}\n\n<endoftext>An adviser to Theresa May has expressed concerns that the new Tory leadership team has no economic and financial expert.\n\nThere have been claims of a ‘cabal’ on the Tory right which is running the Tory party.

"182"|"How to get rid of hiccups?"|"\nI have been experiencing the most ridiculous hiccups in my entire life. They happen randomly and are simply awful. They are very uncomfortable, to the point that I have felt my tongue touching my teeth.\n\nI have tried every remedy you can possibly imagine to cure this. Most of the remedies involved bending your head over a sink, swallowing the fingers you used to pinch yourself, blowing into your cheeks, inserting a pin into your cheek, freezing your lips, sweating all over my body, rolling around on the floor, running around naked, putting my hand in a hot water bottle, drinking a bottle of water, putting ice cubes in my mouth, putting my hand in hot water and then trying to make it go away on my own, doing Valsalva's maneuver, having other people pinch me, and doing the Valsalva maneuver. None of them worked.\n\nI even experimented with the suggestion in the One Minute Cure that my body can't handle the sugar. For six days straight I consumed only coffee and white bread. In other words, no breads, no wheat, no grains of any kind. For six days I avoided red meat, processed meat, and most sugars, processed foods, eggs, and milk. For the first day I did not drink alcohol.\n\nOn the third day I fell asleep for an hour, then passed out for five hours.\n\nOn the fifth day I passed out for over ten hours.\n\nOn the seventh day I woke up at 2:30 in the morning because of the intense screaming in my head, possibly caused by lack of food. Then I drank two liters of Coca-Cola.\n\nAfter which I vomited two liters.\n\nFinally, the ninth day was the day when the hiccups finally went away.\n\nHow did I do it? I don't know. I did it.\n\nNow my body is back to normal. But the question still remains: why was I having hiccups in the first place? It had to do with cravings and the chemical connection to food.\n\nI found out that one of the chemicals that causes the hiccups is a chemical called "acetone." When you smell something that contains acetone, it changes into "carbon dioxide," which is the same chemical that is exhaled when you hiccup. In addition to this chemical reaction, your muscles feel tight because they are holding in the exhalation.\n\nThe solution is to drink\n"
"183"|"How to calculate gpa?"|"\nFirst of all, I hope that this question is not inappropriate and that I will receive an answer from those who can help me.\nI'm a student of bachelor in sport and physical education. Currently I am in my second year of university. I'm more than happy with my grades so far, as I achieved A average.\nI've recently discovered that my first year GPA is B- (not an A!) and I'm really regretting my decision in that case.\nI didn't pay much attention to the fact that my official grade isn't an A. Maybe I was expecting some mistake and then realize it a little later, but... how can I calculate the GPA, both for first and second year?\nThanks in advance for every help.\n\nA:\n\nThe GPA is calculated like this:\n(attempt - lowest failure - lowest incompleteness) / (attempt - lowest failure - lowest incompleteness)\n\nFirst year:\n\n64 attempts, +1 in add/drop / 26 failures, -10 in incompleteness\n\nThis means the score is:\n(64 + 1 - 26 - 10) / (64 + 1 - 26 - 10) = 4.8\n\nSecond year:\n\n56 attempts, +1 in add/drop / 24 failures, -5 in incompleteness\n\nThis means the score is:\n(56 + 1 - 24 - 5) / (56 + 1 - 24 - 5) = 4.95\n\nThis is quite easy to calculate if you take into account the different situations in which the numbers can arise. If you have been unlucky and have failed a few times and had much lower grades, you will have to be careful in calculating the final GPA.\n\n<endoftext>One Sotheby's Eau de Toilette\n\n0.05oz / 1.5ml\n\nSale: $185.00 $54.75Save: 86% off\n\nFree Shipping in the US\n\n/one-sothebys-eau-de-toilette/srpG29qxBgvjIf2dpc3OuHnE/product.htm?categoryId=28\n\nDescription\n\nOne Sotheby's Eau de Toilette\n\nOne Sotheby's Eau de Toilette was designed by Brit perfumer Joyce Rose and celebrated by Sotheby's.

"185"|"How to draw a dog?"|"\nThe answer is simple. It depends on the subject of the work. In general, the proportions are a bit more robust and more stable. The first thing is to understand what style of art it is and how to connect the two. I will try to answer the following questions:\n\nwhat kind of dog is it?\n\n- Check the proportions.\n\n- Is the view a side, right side or any other side?\n\n- If the dog is a representation of some specific animal, it is mandatory to remember the proportions of the creature to the size of the overall design.\n\n- If you design a figure, you should use a good proportion between the head and the body. Head:legs=1 : head:legs=4.5 – Head:legs=3 : head:legs=1.5 – Should be 1.6, if you design a figure.\n\nLet’s take the case of a dog design with many perspectives. Each face has different proportions.\n\nFig. 1\n\nThe right side has 2 proportion factors in comparison with the left side. They are 3:1 : 1:3.\n\nIn this case, this dog is 3x greater than the left side. These are the proportions of the image. That means that the scale of the subject is greater on the right.\n\nOn the left side, we have a perspective 2.5. The overall design is smaller than the left side. It is worth to look at the relationship of the legs with the body and the head, that can create a good composition for the dog.\n\nFig. 2\n\nThe right side has 2 proportion factors in comparison with the left side. They are 3:1 : 1:3.\n\nIn this case, this dog is 3x greater than the left side. These are the proportions of the image. That means that the scale of the subject is greater on the right.\n\nOn the left side, we have a perspective 2.5. The overall design is smaller than the left side. It is worth to look at the relationship of the legs with the body and the head, that can create a good composition for the dog.\n\nIf the image represents a very small dog, it is better to keep the original proportions and the proportions of the subject. If the image represents a big dog, its proportions should be bigger than the dog in the image.\n\nFig. 3\n\nIn general\n"
"186"|"How to make a paper airplane?"|"\nA paper airplane is a simple object to make. By bending paper and folding it several times, a paper airplane is made. The origin of paper airplanes is unknown, but it was invented by Julius Tandler. It is known that paper airplanes became an Olympic sport in 2008. The official Olympic history has the following words about the paper airplane: “During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, the paper airplane was introduced as a novel sport. Competitions, however, were only held in Berlin, between February and March, 1940.” In 1948, the first World Championship was held, and the paper airplane has become an Olympic sport with the success of the first women’s World Championship held in 1971. A blue paper airplane was the flag of the International Olympic Committee during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nMaking a paper airplane\n\nWe will make a paper airplane using a roll of paper called “French Paper”. You should first make a fold in the paper and then cut it in half with a scissor or your razor. The fold will be at the left and right sides of the paper. A sketch of a paper airplane is made and then the tail is made from the two sheets by bending each of the sheets in the shape of a U, for example. The middle part should be bent at the edge and the flap should be folded to make the tail. To make a small paper airplane, the fold is made in such a way that the edge of the middle part does not become so thick. The length of a paper airplane is about 3.5-5 cm, and its thickness is not thicker than 0.5 mm. Make paper airplanes according to the size of the paper you use.\n\nHow to fold paper\n\nFirst, you need to fold the paper in a way such that it becomes a “U”. If you can fold the paper in such a way, make a fold along the left side and the right side. You can hold the paper by the edges and fold the paper at the center using a ruler. Then, a fold is made in the center of the middle part to make a tail. The fold you just made becomes the bottom of the plane.\n\nHow to make a paper airplane\n\nAs shown in the drawing, the paper airplane is folded by creating a fold at the left and right sides of the paper, then a U-shaped fold is created in the middle part. The folding is repeated until the paper is folded\n"

Have you tried them? If you are, do you know whether they really work?\n\nI have. The reasons are: I’ve been on both sides of the table. I’ve been with companies that sold these pillow and I’ve been with a firm that sells nose plugs and nasal pillows.\n\nThe biggest issue with the Nasal Pillows is that they are impossible to use properly. People think that you have to use a pillow like a dog, hold it up against your face and use it to block your nose to prevent your airway from collapsing.\n\nWhile there are different Nasal Pillow models that are sold, the problem with the pillow is that it’s impossible to use properly. This is one of the main reasons that people say that Nasal Pillows do not work and why they don’t help their snoring problem.\n\nThis simple fact goes against every piece of evidence and marketing material I’ve come across. As soon as the pillow is installed, the airway is blocked. No one with half a brain would try to use Nasal Pillows like this.\n\nAs soon as you try to use a Nasal Pillow like a dog and hold it against your face, you’ll get the airway blocked. A nose plug is a tool designed to keep your nose open, but the snoring pillow keeps your nose closed.\n\nThis is one of the biggest problems with all the Nasal Pillows out there today.\n\nIf you are serious about stopping your snoring problem, you need to buy a mouth guard and pair it with a nose plug. This is the absolute best way to keep your nose open for the next twelve hours.\n\nHaving the best snoring mouth guard does not mean you can go back to sleeping next to the snorer. In fact, using a mouth guard in combination with a nose plug is the most effective way to stop snoring.\n\nBelow, I’m going to reveal why the Nasal Pillow does not work and how you can stop snoring in\n"
"196"|"How to fall asleep?"|"\nWhile everybody dreams differently, the aim of falling asleep is quite similar for everyone. There are however many things which one can do and have an impact on one's ability to fall asleep. How often should you go to bed, when to lay down, when to stop eating. Sleep begins when you go to bed, and ends when you wake up. After you go to sleep, your brain continues working and storing information in a process called "Sleep Learning". This information is stored in long term memory, as well as much shorter term memory that has an impact on your capacity for learning in the following day. When you go to bed you also go through a process called "sleep physiology" or "sleep preparation", which has an impact on your ability to fall asleep and sleep the following night. Sleep physiologists can learn what is good for each individual, by controlling what they do at the time of going to bed. Some physiologists believe that even now it is better for everyone to control his physiological sleep preparations as it will prevent sleep problems. In this article we will see how to prepare yourself in advance for the next night.\n\nSource: andrespernyo/pixabay\n\nThe basics\n\nIt is very important that you go to bed at the same time every night. One of the most important things in falling asleep is your sleep-wake schedule, or even better: your circadian rhythm. For your circadian rhythm to be working properly, you should go to bed in the evening and wake up in the morning. If you go to bed later than the morning, it will be much harder to fall asleep, and you will need more time to fall asleep. Going to bed earlier than your circadian rhythm (which starts at ~6pm) also causes trouble falling asleep. Make sure that your last thought before you fall asleep is good or happy, instead of worrying about tomorrow. If you worry a lot you will sleep much worse and you will fall asleep much later. If you are already asleep, you won't be able to worry about tomorrow.\n\nYou should go to sleep at the same time every night. If you sleep in a different time-zone every night, your brain will start adjusting to the different sleep-wake schedules. So if you do that, your circadian rhythm will be damaged, and you will have a much harder time falling asleep, sleeping and getting up in the morning. Also, if you don't go to bed at the same time every night, it will be harder for your brain to\n"

What makes chess so special is that it can be played for fun or for a real purpose - winning a match or gaining recognition. There is a learning curve, that however can be overcome. Whether you are an expert in chess or just having a good time, learning chess can be a fantastic and unforgettable experience. All you need is to find a good chess teacher and regular practice.\n\nThere are many chess players in the world. Most of them are too concerned about being an expert to consider that they are learning. Most of them only know the end of the game and only the moves that get them to the end.\n\nA chess expert? Chess never ends. Never. Even a game that you have won can continue on forever. The expert play the end game, their opponent, and takes advantage of all available material. He or she keeps up with all moves, all pieces, all time, at the same speed and from any possible position.\n\nHow does this happen? What makes a good chess teacher? First of all, you need to be dedicated and learn at any time you can. When I play chess I have put aside my work and rest for several hours every day. When I am playing, the rest of my life is put on hold until I reach the end. It has taken me a long time to develop this discipline.\n\nAlthough chess can be very good and you can play well, no one is the best chess player in the world.

"201"|"How to get rid of fleas?"|"\nWe have all heard the nightmare stories of dogs that lived on the streets that were obviously flea infested and did not seem to have any sort of flea problem. We were appalled when the dog came home with a huge black head and back with no fleas. We immediately dug into the books and for most of us, this was a big fat NO!!\n\nIt is true that you can not treat your dog for fleas once they are already on your dog, but once they are on, you can certainly keep the fleas away with the following tactics.\n\n1. You need to understand that fleas can not live outside of your dog. Your dog can have fleas on her and it may not bother her at all. She may actually like the little pill bugs and want to scratch her back. The real problem is that they have begun to hatch in your dog and the developing fleas are a problem for you. You can keep these baby fleas out of your home by cleaning and vaccinating your dog every month.\n\n2. You have to be aware of your own environment. The reason we have problems is because the fleas themselves or their larval stage were in the environment, whether it be your home or your dog's environment. They are now living in the environment. Fleas are simply busy reproducing. The heat and moisture of the environment allows these new larvae to grow in your environment. You need to understand that even if you vacuum every week and change your pillow case once a week, the environment is still a breeding ground for fleas. I am always concerned about the health of the fleas because they are living on my cat. We do not allow fleas or ticks in the house because they can be a health problem for both cat and people.\n\n3. You should make sure that your dog has never had a problem with fleas. This is probably the most important and hardest part to control. Fleas usually go undetected in a dog and the dog can keep her coat clean for weeks or even months. You will never be able to tell just by looking at the dog if she is flea free. It is much better to vaccinate your dog on a monthly basis. Also, you should make sure that you are vaccinating your dog for both internal and external parasites. Many dogs in the country are kept out of doors where they may encounter parasites. The little animals that nibble at your dog's ankles may be dogs parasites that give them a rash or\n"
"202"|"How to divide fractions?"|"\nA big question I’ve been faced with lately is how to divide fractions. I’ve never really paid too much attention to it until I recently picked up an A1 math book in an attempt to better my math foundation for an upcoming test. As a result, I’ve found myself trying to figure out how to divide fractions that I’ve never dealt with before, which I found to be quite a daunting task. Of course, this book mentioned dividing by fractions, so I thought, “Hey, I’ve probably already encountered fractions before in my math class…” I took a closer look, and I discovered that I’ve encountered two types of fractions:\n\nthe standard fractions like 1/2\n\nthe fractions with an expression like 1/3 x 4/5 or 1/2 x 4/7\n\nClearly, when dealing with fractions that end in a slash and have an expression next to them, I can just divide each part by its decimal, right? Wrong! I recently taught myself how to divide by fractions for a second time so I could write this article, and I found that there is a subtle difference between the two types.\n\nTo make it a bit easier to deal with, I’ll be dealing with some more basic fractions and then move onto the more difficult ones.\n\nBasic fractions\n\nFor the basic fractions, we’ll be dealing with 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 1/5.\n\nNotice that each of these fractions are ending in the same number: a slash and a decimal number. If we just divide each by its decimal, we’ll get a decimal number.\n\nWe can think of each of these as a fraction that contains both its decimal and its denominator. In this case, the denominator is always 2 because each denominator is paired with a numerator of 1. However, not all fractions like this are equivalent. Some fractions with the same denominator may have a different numerator and vice-versa.\n\nAnother important thing to note is that these three equivalent fractions are also fractions with the decimal point at the very beginning. This means that we can’t just skip over it and get the decimal of the fraction itself.\n\nIn this case, since 1/4 is 3/4, we have to move the decimal point to the very beginning. Notice that the denominator 4 becomes the denominator 3\n"

My grammar is not that good yet. How to start a conversation in English? How do I speak? Is my grammar and pronunciation correct? Please tell me how I should approach a conversation with someone. I mean how should I begin it? How should I react to my friend talking too much about herself? What is the importance of eye contact? I am in a panic of beginning to learn English because I want to be a good English speaker. But I am not sure how to start a conversation. How do I manage this problem?\n\nDo you like talking to people or just people of the same culture?\nI prefer talking to people from my own culture. What should be the first step?\n\nI must admit this is a very tough question. It might also be that you might come across a bit harsh, as you are a foreigner and it may not be what you are used to, but let's try and see what you can come up with.\n\nIn terms of creating a conversation or simply starting a conversation, the two main stages are:\n\n- Approaching the other person: That can be done in many different ways, but you need to find a comfortable way of saying something to them and gaining their attention. They will usually give a bit of eye contact and nod their head if they want to hear what you are saying. You should also consider the cultural differences, as different countries have different ways of communicating, so be ready to learn.\n\n- Asking your first question: This is where you can ask anything that you like, such as "How are you doing?". If you just wait to ask a question and you are uncomfortable about it, you may feel bad about the whole situation.\n\n- Responding to the question: This is where you should ask the other person if you can assist him/her, or if he/she can help you.\n\n- End the conversation: This might be the hardest part, but is usually a good ending to a conversation. You don't have to answer your friend's question, but you can say something like "Ok, well see you soon!" or something to that extent.\n\nIt is also important to have a good sense of humour and create jokes. This should be the first thing you do.\n\nNow, let's start with another language. "How to\n"
"204"|"How to add fractions?"|"How to add fractions? Is it enough to put denominator to denominator and the two numerators to numerator?\n\nA:\n\nAs mentioned in another answer, the rules of number format look a little different for fractions than for decimal numbers.\nThat said, using decimal numbers as a comparison is sometimes difficult. Suppose that you have a page full of\n\nin which all the fractions on the left are denominators and all the ones on the right are the fractions themselves, and\nyou are interested in "positioning" the fraction nearest to the origin (the 1) first. If we decide that fractions having the same numerator and denominator should be arranged in descending order according to their distance to the origin, we are comparing two series that make it harder to compare:\n$\begin{array}{cccc}\n& r & \color{red} s & \color{green} t \\\n\hline\n1 & 1 & \color{red} 1 & \color{green} 0.1 \\\n2 & 0.3 & \color{red} 0.3 & \color{green} 0.2 \\\n3 & 0.1 & \color{red} 0.1 & \color{green} 0.1 \\\n4 & 0.03 & \color{red} 0.03 & \color{green} 0.03 \\\n\hline\n\end{array}$\nWhich "order" is the "right" one, and how should you do it in practice? It doesn't have to be decided by a simple formula: it may just have to be done by eye. You can use any method you choose, including rules of thumb, to put the "inner" fractions first and to consider only cases where the denominator is smaller.\nI like to compare things I'm sorting by two parameters simultaneously, so that I get rid of the problem completely. If we consider that both 1, 2, 3 and 4 have the same contribution to the result, and we decide that the "inner" fractions are the ones we want to put first (all the ones on the left, just on the top), and that we want the fraction on the left to be closer to the origin, then we get\n$\begin{array}{cccc}\n& r & \color{red} s & \color{green} t \\\n\hline\n4 & 1 & \\n"

And I want to express my gratitude to each of you who has taken the time to share yourself with me through my writings, the teaching, the coaching, the therapy, the personal development programs and the retreats.\n\nHow to make a bow?\n\nThis is the message I am giving you right now, this moment.\n\n“Holding hands,” I tell you.\n\nMake a bow and hold hands with yourself. Hold hands with the universe. Hold hands with the earth. Hold hands with your self and with the other in the human experience.\n\nTogether we are not only creative and diverse, but creative and diverse with it. In a world that is human, there is only human. To use only human or to use all. You are already at peace. So there is nothing to worry about.\n\nPeople who are dissatisfied with their situation, for some reason, will always be dissatisfied.\n\nSo don’t feel bad about yourself or your life. If something is not working for you, then try another approach or another way. If you are not getting what you want, try something else. You can always change your mind. The human mind is a powerful tool. The way your mind works is a result of your values and the way you use your mind.\n\nIf you need a bow, you can simply stop. Just stop. Stop creating such a tension in the head and the body and the heart. Stop trying to control everything, including your life. You can only create whatever you are willing to see.\n\nIf you are not the creator of your reality, then who is?\n\nIf you can create a new reality, you are free.\n\nIn spite of all the violence, wars, confusion and harm that is created by our history, you are a creator of your reality.\n\nYou can create a wonderful, beautiful, loving reality, the way you want it to be. You do not need to struggle. You are free, you have power, and you can choose to be happy or unhappy.\n\nOr even bad and sad.\n\nBut remember, life is full of both. If you are good, you can be good. If you are bad, you can be bad.\n"

Recently I heard from some friends that they had spent some time working on their comic and did manage to make a bit of headway, so it got me thinking: what I really need to do is make a cartoon of myself. And while I’m sure a few of you are sitting there thinking “What about the government? What about credit cards? Have you thought this through?” well, this post is going to answer all those questions!\n\nStep 1: What do you want to draw?\n\nSo you’re going to draw a picture of yourself. But what is your goal? The artist on the above cartoon wants to represent himself as a space pirate; the artist of this cartoon wants to emphasize the simplicity of the stripes on his shirt; the artist of this cartoon wants to reveal his hidden thoughts by concentrating on his mustache; the artist of the last one just wants to draw themselves, whether they’re the hero or the villain of the story.\n\nFigure out what you want to convey and you’ll have a clearer idea of what you want to do in your cartoon.\n\nStep 2: Who is your character?\n\nLook at your cartoon again. Is this person you want to draw exactly the same person you were when you drew the cartoon? You’re going to have to change the person you want to draw. If you want to draw yourself, then maybe you’d be more interested in this drawing:\n\nYes, of course I’m wearing a cape. It’s Monday.\n\nOnce you’ve determined that this is the person you want to draw, think about what kind of person they are and how you think they should act or react. In this case, the character would be the typical US worker. They’re wearing work clothes because they work in an office; they’re not getting drunk because their boss isn’t a fan of alcohol.\n\nNow, just draw the picture. Be aware of how the lines and shapes should look; if you try to draw a shape just because it looks good, you may end up looking like a kindergartner:\n\nNext, add some details to the picture:\n\nPaint out the eyes and mouth with a pencil.

However, I also don't want to live in that mode 24/7 so I'm devising ways to get out of that "this is no-where land" place I live.\n\nMy plan is to get to work in the morning (before the coffee shop gets crowded) then work in the office or wherever is quiet and don't even want to talk to anyone, then go to the bedroom (it is quiet, as in nobody else is there, since everyone goes home for the weekend) and just lay down. I will not eat breakfast (because I'm so sick, I can't) and then go back to bed after about 5 minutes of being up. I will sleep maybe five hours.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to wake up when I need to - after I go to bed, I start to get that stuck feeling again and that is when I can't sleep. When I need to be somewhere or do something, I'll get out of bed and go to do that - no matter how long I've been out of bed and I don't want to stay up too late, or eat lunch, etc. I need to take\n"
"210"|"How to tie a scarf?"|"\nHow do you tie a scarf?\n\nA scarf is a most convenient accessory. Scarves are easy to wear; they’re practical and they add a bit of a “nice touch” to an outfit. The scarf can be worn wrapped around the neck and shoulders in the warmer months, or they can be used as a shawl in cold weather. Scarves are a good idea for traveling as well. You can travel with a scarf by itself or with a stylish but casual jacket or sweater.\n\nThere are many varieties of scarves that you can choose from. Many scarves are knotted on the side of the neck. Some scarves have long tassels, some have different colors or prints, and there are scarves that have a variety of materials, including lace, feathers, and fur. Depending on the material of the scarf, you may need a special scarf tie or a different knotting style to keep the scarf secure.\n\nIn this article we’ll look at the knotting styles and styles of scarves to help you choose which is best for you.\n\nMaterials\n\nThere are many different types of scarves that you can choose from. Knitted scarves are the easiest to knot, and they can be machine knitted or hand knitted. Knitted scarves tend to be very tightly knotted so they’re easy to tie but not as comfortable to wear as a hand knitted scarf. Knitted scarves are often made out of acrylic or synthetic yarn. Knitted scarves are suitable for colder weather.\n\nHand knitted scarves are the most comfortable to wear but harder to tie and often more expensive. Hand knitted scarves can be made of silk, wool, or other natural fibers.\n\nTassels are the most traditional way to decorate a scarf. Tassels are fun and can be added to a scarf for an extra bit of flair and variety. Tassels have a very long history and are very popular in Europe and the Middle East. The best style is one that ends in a traditional knot at the bottom of the scarf. Tassels can be added in a variety of materials, including: tassels made of ribbon, silk, or wool.\n\nFur is very fashionable now and can be used in a variety of ways to add interest and texture to a scarf. A good type of fur is fox or mink, though we also have camel hair as well. Some fur scarves\n"
"211"|"How to know if a guy likes you?"|"\nHow to know if a guy likes you?\n\nMen are confusing. I’m serious. Have you ever known one who has one thing to say about most women but has nothing nice to say about any single woman? They may seem nice and sweet, but they will go back on their word after the first girl to arrive at the party or get first break at the last interview.\n\nThe type of guy I’m talking about could be a very intelligent man, a good looking guy with a good job and a family. With these kind of guys, you will never understand what their problem is. You will never understand why they behave in certain way with each woman they meet and why they are distant and become rude after they slept with the first girl.\n\nThis type of guys will be kind, handsome, smart, responsible, loyal and honest. But the problem is they tend to feel possessive and weird towards women.\n\nI have been hearing similar stories for years now. I can’t seem to do the same since I’m single and have always been having a loving relationship with a nice man. But, I am telling you this guy will not even know how to appreciate you. You will have to keep your guard up. And you will have to make sure this is not the type of guy who needs a second partner so he can get attention and relieve his painful feelings of depression or emptiness.\n\nBecause with him, you will never know if he is angry with you, happy with you, jealous with you or depressed with you.\n\nDo you know guys like this?\n\nI am asking myself. How do I know if a guy is a serial killer? How do I know if a guy likes me?\n\nThere is a trick to know if a guy likes you. Of course, it will be tricky and very hard to gauge. But I have found a couple of ways to recognize whether the guy is not interested in you or has a problem with you.\n\nHow to tell if a guy is not interested in you?\n\nLet’s start with the easy one. This trick is quite common among the top men and women of our time. But we only notice it after some time in relationship. I just recently noticed this and I was shocked!\n\n1.

"212"|"How to french kiss?"|"\nHow to french kiss?\n\nHow to french kiss?\n\nHow to french kiss?\n\nIs it easy?\n\nAs for people who prefer something more formal, a French kiss. Although it is one of the most important things that can be done in sex, very few people know how to do it right. This tutorial will teach you how to french kiss from scratch. And don't be scared, if you're still not sure, do not worry. You will be ready to French Kiss in no time.\n\nStep 1: Warm up the Lips and Forehead\n\nYou can kiss the French kiss with or without tongue.\n\nPre-requisite: It's better to pre-cool your lips and the forehead before you start doing anything else.\n\nBut as a personal preference you may prefer to warm the lips up and foreheads with a nice cold or ice pack.\n\nHow to french kiss - Friction between the lips and cold is not a good idea. I use ice pack for this purpose.\n\nHow to french kiss - Always think about your partner's comfort. The same thing goes for the partner.\n\nStep 2: Nose and TONGUE ARE CRITICAL PART OF FRENCH KISS\n\nTo have a nice and clean french kiss you will need to use your nose and tongue, like you would during sex. A loose tip of your tongue will go inside the partner's mouth for some good ole ouch. If you want to do a french kiss, but don't want to get mouth chocolates all over your partner, I suggest you don't use your tongue or fingers to stimulate the partner. This will give you an impression like a foot jam, but only your nose and tongue. You can use your fingers to massage your partner, but only with the second hand.\n\nHow to french kiss - If you want to have a clean french kiss, you will have to keep your tongue inside the partner's mouth and use your nose as a'magnet' to keep your partner's tongue inside the partner's mouth. You will need to thrust your tongue from the back of the partner's tongue in one long sweeping motion. This will turn a traditional french kiss into a controlled penetration.\n\nStep 3: Grab the Partner\n\nAt this point your lips should be together, as far as you can. If they are not, you may need to do some manual work. I usually see a lot of people don't realize that\n"

She asks you to go home with her or not. You need to make the choice. Either you go home with her or with not her. This choice defines how much you like her or if she is just a pleasure for you. If you don’t do it, you will lose a lot of opportunities. But if you go home, the danger is greater. Maybe she does not see you again or you go the wrong direction.\n\n2.- Actions speak louder\n\nMany people don’t take actions before going on a date. They don’t know what to do. But if you want to know if a girl likes you, you have to take action. It shows how much you want her. With actions, you can learn if she likes you or not.

She won’t like this, and you will have to find out how to ask her.\n\n5.- When a woman like a man\n\nYou do not have to seek a woman who likes you. You are already like the woman you are looking for.

If you are the same way, then the guide for how to get a girlfriend will surely help you out. Don’t worry, I know a lot of girls (and guys) who were unable to get a girlfriend, but a few smart moves can get you there.\n\nLet's start.\n\nHow to get a girlfriend? Before, after, even during, you're studying, make time for yourself. - Vikram Seth\n\nMost girls can give a guy compliments, but many guys just overlook them. You should acknowledge those compliments if the girl mentions them, but it’s okay to ignore them sometimes if the compliments are common. For example, a girl mentions that you look handsome in a certain outfit, and it's one of your favorite outfits.\n\nYes, compliment her, but tell her that it's a common thing, and not your favorite one. Even if you do, it will help. You have to develop an arsenal of compliments. If she compliments you for looking handsome, tell her that you know she's pretty, but you're trying to be her best friend. After a few compliments you'll start noticing that girls that compliment you are usually the more common types of girls, which is a good sign. When a girl says that you look handsome and you don't like it, it means that she likes you. (of course she's not going to say that you look handsome, but it's good that you notice when she is flirting with you).\n\nThe most important thing to be aware of while being flirty is how you're being. Don't be annoying. - Vinayak Pathak\n\nThe most important thing to be aware of while being flirty is how you’re being. Don’t be annoying. Don't try too hard, but be confident. When you’re being confident, you don’t feel the need to show off your knowledge. You don’t feel the need to know too many things, but you know what you want. At the end of the day, your goal is to get a girlfriend, not to impress her.\n\nDon’t be too much of a show off, but try to convey the confidence that you have to her. Don’t be a distraction\n"

This basic recipe is very useful for your next pasta project.\n\nTortellini are smallish balls made from a firm dough, and stuffed with meat, vegetables or a mix of both, and then rolled in egg. The Italians like to call it tortellino, and they do make a great version, but in the past few years I’ve taken to the dish of stuffed pasta known as tortellini, known in Italy as tortellini di neve.\n\nOf course, you can fill them with all sorts of stuff: seafood, meat, vegetables.

That claim might not be completely true, but it definitely is delicious! It was the best pulled pork recipe I've tried so far, and I've tried quite a few.\n\nI made a couple changes from the recipe because I didn't have a specific cut of pork to make this.

Everybody knows how to make rice and sashimi, but that's about it. If you want to make real sushi you will need a few skills that a lot of people neglect.\n\nThis is a recipe for making nigiri sushi. But sushi is more than just nigiri! That's why this is the full article. Read it from the beginning to the end, from the basic recipe to the explanation of a perfect sushi.\n\nBasic Sushi Rice\n\nAs any other kind of rice, sushi rice is made of equal parts of white and brown rice. The ratio is 3 parts of brown to 1 of white, but it can vary. In this recipe we use 5 parts of brown rice to 1 part of white rice. The rice you use must be short-grain, never long-grain rice, like jasmine or basmati. Long-grain rice does not absorb water so well. When soaked it becomes hard to work with and has a grainier taste. If you use short-grain rice you should cook it for 30 minutes instead of 25. This is because the long-grain rice is hard to digest. This can be unhealthy.\n\nThis recipe makes 1 cup of rice. If you want to serve more people, just multiply the recipe with your needs.\n\nHow to make nigiri sushi rice\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 ½ cup of sushi rice\n\n¼ cup of sugar (or honey)\n\nMethod:\n\nRinse and wash the rice. Drain it. In a medium bowl combine the rice, sugar and a half cup of water and mix well. Cover the bowl and put it in the refrigerator. This process is called steaming the rice. Steaming lets the moisture in the rice become absorbed. It makes it easier to mix the rice.\n\nRemove the steamed rice from the refrigerator and fluff it up with your fingers. Let the rice sit for 5 minutes or until the moisture is absorbed. Add the remaining water and cover the bowl again. This is also called steaming the rice.\n\nRemove the rice from the steamer and combine it with a large wooden spatula. Make sure you combine all of the rice evenly. There shouldn't be any lumps of dry rice left. A lump of dry rice may taste bitter. Add more water if needed. Make sure to wash the\n"

It’s way easy to prepare and the result is one tasty omelette.\n\nI say it again: not only is it super easy to make, it’s also super easy to customize. The olives? Leave them out, add them in. Mozzarella? Omit it, or sprinkle some Parmesan cheese. Prosciutto? Go for it. This is actually the only omelette that has a complete freedom of ingredients. All in all, I love experimenting with my food.\n\nWhen I cook, I keep an eye on the ingredients, looking for “the perfect” combination. And when you find it, I want you to say: “Hey girl, where’d you find this?” For me, this combination was spot-on. You can’t go wrong with it.\n\nHow to make an omelette? The results are beyond amazing. And I have to admit I was pretty excited when I heard about this combination. I knew I had to make this omelette. I am absolutely in love with cheese, olives and feta. When I see these combinations together, I get this big-ass happy feeling in my stomach. I just love them.\n\nOne more thing: I like my omelettes on the thinner side. So instead of the usual mix of 1:1 eggs and milk, I prefer a ratio of around 3:4. The batter should be smooth and runny.\n"

"224"|"How to get rid of dandruff?"|"\nDandruff, also known as seborrheic dermatitis, is a very common problem that affects people of all ages and both genders. This type of skin condition results in dry, flaky and itchy scalp. Many people have a problem with dandruff and even if you don’t, chances are you have a friend who does. Dandruff isn’t caused by any single thing and therefore it can take years to completely rid your scalp of this problem. Over time, however, the condition can worsen and with that come the signs and symptoms of dandruff – even if you’re a clear-headed, diligent, super-honest person.\n\nDandruff can often be very itchy and may even be accompanied by unpleasant scratching sounds. This is especially true if you have black hair, since the black hair is very porous and tends to stick close to your skin. Be sure to apply a moisturizer after shampooing, to keep your skin moisturized and help it from getting too dry.\n\nYou should also avoid hair products with hard grains, as these tend to end up in the scalp, and then in your hair. Avoid products with sodium lauryl sulfate, which tends to make your hair look like straw after every shampoo.\n\nIn order to get rid of dandruff, you’ll need to use a treatment or hair product that contains sulfur. Sulfur is an acid, which means it will strip away the dead skin from the scalp and allow the new skin to grow more naturally. If you’re using a product containing sulfur, be sure to shampoo at least 3-4 times a week in order to eliminate all of the dead skin on your scalp.\n\nSulfur is the most commonly used dandruff treatment, and for good reason. It doesn’t have any bad side effects, and is the cheapest effective treatment on the market. There are different kinds of sulfur available, so be sure to select one that’s suitable for your needs. You should also look for a product that contains 10-15% sulfur to work the best.\n\nBefore applying any sulfur, you should shampoo your hair. Sulfur is very harsh on the hair, and will leave the hair red. You’ll be surprised by how red your hair gets, and it’s not pretty. Some people find that the redness becomes even more severe after using sulfur. If this happens to\n"

"227"|"How to tune a guitar?"|"\nTuning your guitar is an important part of guitar playing. You'll need to tune your guitar every now and then to keep it in tune, and it will often be necessary to re-tune it before every performance.\n\nSome guitarists tune their guitars by ear. They choose a tuner and stick it into the sound hole to make a note as accurate as possible. Other guitarists tune their guitars using a pitch pipe. The pitch pipe will allow you to check each string individually by pressing a button. You then press the strings against the pipe in turn to get the pitches you want. Finally, some guitarists tune their guitar using pitch pipes and a guitar tuner. The advantage of tuning by pitch pipe and guitar tuner is that you can then go and tune each string individually by ear.\n\nHow to tune a guitar by ear\n\nFinding the key\n\nThe first step is to find the note you want. This is usually a particular note on the guitar.\n\nThe guitar should be in tune when you are playing it. It should have a tune when you check it. If your guitar has an automatic tuner, use that. If your guitar doesn't have an automatic tuner, find the guitar that does. It's usually very obvious.\n\nWhen you have found the note that you want, you should be looking at the guitar from the side. If you see a string that looks different to the others then that's the string that needs to be tuned.\n\nString groupings\n\nThe string groups are usually a solid color.\n\nMake sure that you look at the names of the strings. You should find the name of the string (placing a piece of string over the string and naming it if you know what you are doing), and then a symbol for the note. For example, an F note will be written as an "F". A "G" note will be an "F#" and a "C" note will be an "A". If you don't know what notes you have, you can look them up.\n\nIf you can't see the name of the string group, then look carefully at the strings above it. Usually the strings are the same size and color, but it's worth checking if you're not sure.\n\nGone - the notes should all be the same size and color. The four strings on the middle frets should match the other four strings, as do the four strings on the neck. This\n"
