// WMI handler.
// Each CommandArg is of the formation shown below, if multiple CommandArgs are present a random one is chosen for execution on each cycle.
// Credential handling is done in the same manner as the SSH handler, see that sample timeline for documentation
// After the <cred_key> is a ';' delimited list of WMI commands that are executed in sequence during a cycle.
// Supported commands:
// GetOperatingSystem
// GetBios
// GetProcessor
// GetUserList
// GetNetworkInfo
// GetFilesList
// GetProcessList
