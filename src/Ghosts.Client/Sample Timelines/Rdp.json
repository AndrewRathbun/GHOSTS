/// RDP handler.
/// Each CommandArg is of the form shown below, if multiple CommandArgs are present a random one is chosen for execution on each cycle.
///  <targetIp>|<credkey>  The targetIP is the IP to use for the RDP connection
/// The <credKey> is only used to retrieve the password of the matching record in the credentials file.
/// The username (if supplied) is  used instead of the logged-in user (can also provide 'domain' keyword in credentials)
/// The password is used if a password  prompt appears on RDP open
///
/// The custom-login HandlerArg is optional, and is an AutoIt sequence to use in case the default login
/// procedure does not work. It is executed when the credential prompt window is detected, you can use AutoIt
/// commands like {TAB}, {ENTER} etc, newlines must seperate the commands. There are three non-standard commands:
///  #USERNAME  - send the username using sendkeys
///  #PASSWORD  - send the password using sendkeys
///  #DELAYnnnn - delay for nnnn milliseconds
///
/// After this sequence is execution, no other action is taken until the RDP session window is detected
///
