/*
  The 'outlook' command for a browser handler allows email via Exchange Outlook client.
  Only Exchange Server 2013 OWA is currently supported
  The credentials file format is the same as the WMI handler and requires  'domain' , 'username', 'password' keywords
  The  Handler is somewhat fragile due to popup status windows randomly interfering with operations, so 
  occasionally an operation (typically reply or create)  will fail. An error count is tracked and reset on
  a successful operation. If the error count reaches 10, then a reset of the browser is done. 
  Chrome seems less error prone than Firefox during operation.

  The 'CommandArgs'  are the same as far the Outlookv2 handler. The HandlerArgs are styled after the Outlookv2 handler.

  The Linux version has been tested under Ubuntu Desktop 20, windows version tested with Windows 10.
  If email attachments are used under Linux, the  xdotool package must be installed, this is needed to automate
  the native OS window that opens when an attachment is added.
  'sudo apt-get install xdotool'
