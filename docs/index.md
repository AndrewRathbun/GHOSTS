# The GHOSTS NPC Framework

Developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI), The GHOSTS Framework is an open-source (OSS) software framework that enables creating, deploying, and orchestrating complex non-player character (NPC) activity within training, exercise, simulation, and educational environments. Within GHOSTS there are several systems and applications, all of which are modular and extendable to fit a wide array of use cases and needs.

GHOSTS is typically run on machines within a virtualized network, often referred to as "the range". This network can be as simple or as complex as required for training and exercise purposes.

    GHOSTS runs very well within the SEI's Crucible Framework ([Source Code](https://github.com/cmu-sei/crucible) and [Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/)) - which we use extensively for training and exercise here at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) (CMU)'s [Software Engineering Institute](https://sei.cmu.edu/), and particularly, [CERT](https://cert.org)

## Documentation

You can find documentation on The GHOSTS Framework and all of its components [here](https://cmu-sei.github.io/ghosts/).

## Core Client

GHOSTS clients simulate what anyone might do at a computer given their particular role or membership within some team. It creates documents, browses websites, downloads files, and uses all sorts of popular applications on many versions of Windows and Linux machines. Whether you're a friendly administrator or a powerful cyber adversary, GHOSTS can replicate your expected behavior.

GHOSTS has many use cases in cyber training and exercises, most notably for bringing non-player characters (NPCs) to life, but GHOSTS can be used for many other purposes where realistic activity on a computer or network is needed as well: Testing, or generating network or activity datasets, for example.

???+ warning "Do I need the API?"
    Although clients are fully functional without the API server, the latter enables logging, reports, and remote administration capabilities. Without the API, changes to clients must be managed in some other manner.

## Core API Server

The GHOSTS API enables the control and orchestration of non-player characters (NPCs) within a deployment. It supports logging, reporting, and managing individual, groups of, or entire deployments of client installs.

## ANIMATOR

ANIMATOR is a configurable and extensible library for generating modeling, simulation, and exercise data. We like to say it creates, "NPCs so real, they sell for a premium on the dark web."

At its core, Animator is a realistic user details generator. Its primary function is to create fake identities and accompanying verbose portfolios of personal information. Each generated NPC has over 25 categories of details associated with them, and over a hundred pieces of metadata defining who they are. Each piece of information is generated using sourced datasets in an attempt to distribute characteristics realistically.

## SPECTRE

SPECTRE is our attempt to reduce that agent browsing patterns appear as "computer random". This module modifies user web browser timelines so that they more closely match that agent's preferences over time. We expect this simple model of ML to be used for other types of agent activity in the future.

## Content Servers

GHOSTS content servers are an evolving part of the framework. They exist for several reasons:

1. On an air-gapped network, where we are simulating some subset of the internet, we want more types of browsable content within that range â€” documents, spreadsheets, presentations, pdf files, streamed movies, and the like.
2. We want a broad range of URLs within a site we are representing in the range.
3. We want to simulate a document store, such as SharePoint, OneCloud, or similar, but without the hassle of installing and maintaining those actual systems.

### PANDORA

PANDORA is a python-based web server that responds to all sorts of content requests on-the-fly, and supports a very broad array of URLs. Basically, any request made to a PANDORA server should return a response that corresponds to the request, for example:

| Request                                                                       | Response                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------            |
| `GET` /vault/documents/01012019/report.docx                                   | :material-check: responds with a randomly-generated Word document             |
| `GET` /users/michelle_smith/                                                  | :material-check: responds with a randomly-generated html document             |
| `GET` /video/org/human-resources/eastern-region/06/23/2022                    | :material-check: responds with a randomly-generated streamed video            |

### PANDORA Social

In the spirit of the original PANDORA, this server also responds to a very broad array of URLs but enables clients to POST/PUT/DELETE to it as well, for example:

| Request                                                                       | Response                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------            |
| `POST` /images                                                                | :material-check: responds with a url to the saved image file                  |
| `POST` /                                                                      | :material-check: responds with a randomly-generated streamed video            |
| `POST` /users/michelle_smith/af2d00aa-4a89-4af3-baff-1746b556e7a1/            | :material-check: responds with a reply to the original user's social post     |
