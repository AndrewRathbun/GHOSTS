# The GHOSTS NPC Framework

Developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI), The GHOSTS Framework is an open-source (OSS) software framework that enables creating, deploying, and orchestrating complex non-player character (NPC) activity within training, exercise, simulation, and educational environments. Within GHOSTS there are several systems and applications, all of which are modular and extendable to fit a wide array of use cases and needs.

GHOSTS is typically run on machines within a virtualized network, often referred to as "the range". This network can be as simple or as complex as required for training and exercise purposes.

    GHOSTS runs very well within the SEI's Crucible Framework ([Source Code](https://github.com/cmu-sei/crucible) and [Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/)) - which we use extensively for training and exercise here at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) (CMU)'s [Software Engineering Institute](https://sei.cmu.edu/), and particularly, within [CERT](https://cert.org).

## Documentation

You can find documentation on The GHOSTS Framework and all of its components [here](https://cmu-sei.github.io/ghosts/). Each main component's detail is accessible from the main navigation.

## Philosophy

GHOSTS evolved in our quest to create more realistic NPCs within cyberwarfare training and exercise. We began with a 2018 white paper entitled [_GHOSTS in the Machine: A Framework for Cyber-Warfare Exercise NPC Simulation_](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=534316). In that report, we outline how the GHOSTS framework accomplishes the creation of simulations in which NPCs realistically represent a vast array of possible encounters and outcomes. We have continued to follow our initial path since. The litmus has always been that if we looked over someone's shoulder while they were using a computer, that's what GHOSTS should look like.
