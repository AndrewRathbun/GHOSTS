# GHOSTS Content Servers Overview

GHOSTS content servers are an evolving part of the framework. They exist for several reasons:

1. On an air-gapped network, where we are simulating some subset of the internet, we want more types of browsable content within that range â€” documents, spreadsheets, presentations, pdf files, streamed movies, and the like.
2. We want a broad range of URLs within a site we are representing in the range.
3. We want to simulate a document store, such as SharePoint, OneCloud, or similar, but without the hassle of installing and maintaining those actual systems.

> Research by Global WebIndex claims that globally, 59% of the world's population uses social media, and that the average daily use is 2 hours and 29 minutes (July 2022).
